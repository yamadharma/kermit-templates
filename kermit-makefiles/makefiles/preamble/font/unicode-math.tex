%{{{ Math 'style'

% Classically, TEX uses italic lowercase Greek letters and upright
% uppercase Greek letters for variables in mathematics. This is contrary
% to the ISO standards of using italic forms for both upper- and
% lowercase. Furthermore, in various historical contexts, often
% associated with French typesetting, it was common to use upright
% uppercase Latin letters as well as upright upper- and lowercase Greek,
% but italic lowercase latin. Finally, it is not unknown to use upright
% letters for all characters, as seen in the Euler fonts.
