\Abstract{In the study of a phenomenon it is necessary to construct
the model of this phenomenon.  The models differ in their expressive
properties, degree of maturity, requirements. We need quantitative and
qualitative study of model.  We want to get the whole range of models
from first principles.  One of these methodologies is the method of
stochastization of one-step processes.  As a result oftThe application
of methodology to the investigated phenomena we can get more than one
mathematical model (the whole family of models).  We can specify the
preferred methods of investigation for each model of the family. Thus,
we are expanding the range of methods for studying the phenomenon
under investigation.  In the article using RED algorithm as an example
we will illustrate different approaches to framework of the method
stochastization of one-step processes.}
