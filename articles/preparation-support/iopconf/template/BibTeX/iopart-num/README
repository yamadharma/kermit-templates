iopart-num -- BibTeX style for IOP journals

--------------------------------

The iopart-num BibTeX style is intended for use with Institute of
Physics Publishing journals, including Journal of Physics.  A numeric
citation style with Harvard-like formatting is provided, based upon
the specification in "How to prepare and submit an article for
publication in an IOP journal using LaTeX2e" by Graham Douglas (2005).

The style is compatible with, but does not require, the iopart
document class.  It is also compatible with, but does not require,
the natbib package.  

The distribution contains the BibTeX style file (iopart-num.bst), the
source files for the documentation (iopart-num.tex and
iopart-num.bib), and a PDF file of the documentation (iopart-num.pdf).
