# Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings #

<https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html>

Although IEEE does not require a specific format for their conference
articles, IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing provides these optional 
MS Word and LaTeX templates free for use. If you wish, you may link 
to this Web page in its entirety. However, we do not recommend that
you link to individual files because they may be updated or replaced
without notice.

IEEE conference templates contain guidance text for composing and
formatting conference papers. Please ensure that all template text is
removed from your conference paper prior to submission to the
conference.

Failure to remove template text from your paper may result in your
paper not being published.
