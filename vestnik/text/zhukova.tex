\begin{abstract} 
  The notion of rigid geometry is introduced. Rigid geometries include
  Cartan geometries as well as rigid geometric structures in the sense
  of Gromov. Foliations $(M,F)$ with transverse rigid geometries are
  investigated. An invariant $\frak g_0$ of a foliation $(M,F)$ with
  transverse rigid geometry, being a Lie algebra, is introduced. We
  prove that if, for some foliation $(M,F)$ with transverse rigid
  geometry, $\frak g_0$ is zero, then there exists a unique Lie group
  structure on its full basic automorphism group. Some estimates of
  the dimensions of this group depending on the transverse geometry
  are obtained. Examples, illustrating the main results, are
  constructed.

\section{Introduction}
One of the basic objects associated with a geometric structure on a
smooth manifold is its automorphism group. Among the central problems,
there is the question whether the automorphism group can be endowed
with a (finite-dimensional) Lie group structure~\cite{Kob}.

In the theory of foliations with transverse geometries, automorphisms
are understood as diffeomorphisms mapping leaves onto leaves and
preserving transverse geometries. The group of all automorphisms of a
foliation $(M,F)$ with transverse geometry is denoted by ${\cal
  A}(M,F).$ Let ${\cal A}_L(M,F)$ be the normal subgroup of ${\cal
  A}(M,F)$ formed by automorphisms mapping each leaf onto itself. The
quotient group ${\cal A}(M,F)/{\cal A}_L(M,F)$ is called the full
basic automorphism group and is denoted by ${\cal A}_B(M,F).$

In the investigation of foliations $(M,F)$ with transverse geometry it
is naturally to ask the above problem about the existence of a Lie
group structure for the full group ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ of basic
automorphisms of $(M,F).$

Leslie~\cite{Les} was first who solved a similar problem for smooth
foliations on compact manifolds. For foliations with complete
transversal projectable affine connection this problem was studied by
Belko~\cite{Bel}.

The leaf space $M/F$ of the foliation is a diffeological space, and
the group ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ can be considered as a subgroup of the
diffeological Lie group $\mathrm{Diff}(M/F)$. For Lie foliations with
dense leaves on a compact manifold, the diffeological Lie groups
$\mathrm{Diff}(M/F)$ are computed by Hector and Macias-Virgos~\cite{HMV}.

In this work we introduce a notion of a rigid structure. Cartan
geometries~\cite{Kob} and rigid geometric structures in the sense of
Gromov~\cite{AG,G} are rigid structures in our sense. At the same time
almost complex and symplectic structures don't belong to rigid
structures. A manifold equipped with a rigid structure is called a
rigid geometry.

We investigate foliations admitting rigid geometries as transverse
structures and call them by foliations with transverse rigid
geometries (TRG). Cartan foliations~\cite{Minsets,Bl} and $G$-foliations,
where $G$ is a Lie group of finite type, are foliations with TRG.
In particular, Riemannian, pseudo-Riemannian, Lorenz, projective
and conformal foliations belong to the class of foliations under
investigation. The category of foliations with TRG is denoted by
${\frak F}_{TRG}.$ The group ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ is an invariant of
$(M,F)$ in the category ${\frak F}_{TRG}.$

We assume that all the foliations under consideration are modelled
on effective rigid geometries. We construct the foliated bundle
for a foliation $(M,F)$ with TRG and reduce problems on the
automorphism groups and the basic automorphism groups of $(M,F)$
to the ana\-logous problems for $e$-foliations (Theorems~3 and
Proposition~9). Emphasize that these statements are proved without
assumption of completeness of $(M,F).$

For any complete foliation $(M,F)$ with TRG we define the
structure Lie algebra $\frak g_0(M,F)$ and show that $\frak
g_0(M,F)$ is an invariant of this foliation in the category
${\frak F}_{TRG}$ (Proposition~5). One of the main results of this
work is the proof of the theorem asserting that if $\frak
g_0(M,F)$ is zero, then there exists a unique Lie group structure
on ${\cal A}_B(M,F).$ We also obtain some estimates of the
dimensions of these Lie groups depending on the transverse
geometry (Theorem~5).

We give different interpretations of holonomy groups of complete
foliations with TRG (Theorem~4) and find some other sufficient
conditions for the existence of a Lie group structure on ${\cal
A}_B(M,F)$ (Theorem~6). In particular, it is shown that the
structure Lie algebra of any complete proper foliation with TRG is
zero, and ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ is a Lie group (Corollary~2).

We demonstrate that, for a foliation with TRG covered by a
fibration, the condition $\frak g_0(M,F)=0$ is equivalent to the
discreteness of its global holonomy group (Theorem~7).

Examples of computations of the full basic automorphism group of a
foliation with TRG are constructed. Examples 1 and 2 also show
that the group ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ depends on the transverse rigid
geometry of the foliation $(M,F).$

\section{Rigid geometries}

{\bf Parallelizable manifolds.\,} Recall that a manifold
admitted an $e$-structure is called {\it parallelizable.} In other
words, a parallelizable manifold is a pair $(P,\omega),$ where $P$
is a smooth manifold and $\omega$ is a smooth non-degenerate
$\mathbb{R}^m$-valued 1-form $\omega$ on~$P,$ i.~e.,
$\omega_u\colon T_uP\to{\Bbb R}^m$ is an isomorphism of the vector
spaces for each $u\in P.$ Here $m=\dim P.$

{\bf Rigid structures.\,} We will use notations from~\cite{KN1}.
Denote by $P(N,H)$ a principal $H$-bundle with the projection
$p\colon P\to N$. Suppose that the action of $H$ on $P$ is a right
action and $R_a$ is the diffeomorphism of $P$, corresponding to an
element $a\in H.$

Two principal bundles $P(N,H)$ and $\tilde P(\tilde N,\tilde H)$
are called {\it isomorphic} if $H=\tilde H$ and there exists a
diffeomorphism $\Gamma\colon P\to\tilde P$ such that $\Gamma\circ
R_a=\tilde R_a\circ\Gamma,$ $\forall a\in H,$ where $\tilde R_a$
is the transformation of $\tilde P$, corresponding to an element
$a.$


%{\bf Definition 1.} 
\begin{Def}
Let $P(N,H)$ be a principal
$H$-bundle and $(P,\omega)$ be a parallelizable manifold
satisfying the following condition:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] (S) there is an inclusion $\frak h\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ of
the vector space of the Lie algebra $\frak h$ of the Lie group $H$
into vector space $\mathbb{R}^m$ such that
$\omega(A^*)=A,\,\forall A\in\frak h,$ where $A^*$ is the
fundamental vector field on $P$ corresponding to $A.$
\end{itemize}

Then $\xi=(P(N,H),\omega)$ is called a {\it rigid structure} on
the manifold $N.$ A pair $(N,\xi)$ is called a {\it rigid
geometry.}
\end{Def}

%{\bf Definition 2.} 
\begin{Def}
Let $\xi=(P(N,H),\omega)$ and
$\tilde\xi=(\tilde P(\tilde N,\tilde H),\tilde\omega)$ be two
rigid structures. An isomorphism $\Gamma\colon P\to\tilde P$ of
the principal bundles $P(N,H)$ and $\tilde P(\tilde N,\tilde H)$
satisfying the equality $\Gamma^*\tilde\omega=\omega$ is called an
{\it isomorphism} of the rigid structures $\xi$ and $\tilde\xi.$
\end{Def}

Any isomorphism $\Gamma$ of rigid structures $\xi$ and $\tilde\xi$
defines a map $\gamma\colon N\to\tilde N$ such that
$p\circ\Gamma=\gamma\circ p,$ and $\gamma$ is a diffeomorphism
from $N$ to $\tilde N.$ The projection $\gamma$ is called an {\it
isomorphism} of the rigid geometries $(N,\xi)$ and $({\tilde
N},{\tilde \xi}).$

{\bf Induced rigid geometries.\,}
Let $\xi=(P(N,H),\omega)$ be a rigid structure on a manifold $N$
with the projection $p\colon P\to N.$ Let $V$ be an arbitrary open
subset of the manifold $N,$ let $P_V:=p^{-1}(V)$ and
$\omega_V:=\omega|_{P_V}.$ Then $\xi_V:=(P_V(V,H),\omega_V)$ is
also a rigid structure.


%{\bf Definition 3.} 
\begin{Def}
The pair $(V,\xi_V)$ defined above is
called an {\it induced rigid geometry on the open subset} $V$ of
$N.$
\end{Def}

{\bf Gauge transformations.\,}
Let ${\cal A}(\xi)$ be the group of all automorphisms of a rigid
structure $\xi=(P(N,H),\omega).$ It is a Lie group as a closed
subgroup of the group ${\cal A}(P,\omega)$ of all automorphism of
a parallelizable manifold $(P,\omega).$ Denote by ${\cal
A}(N,\xi)$ the group of all automorphisms of the geometry
$(N,\xi),$ i.~e., ${\cal A}(N,\xi):=\{\gamma\in \mathrm{Diff}(
N)\mid\exists\,\Gamma\in{\cal A}(\xi) : p\circ\Gamma=\gamma\circ
p\}.$ Consider the natural group epimorphism $\chi\colon{\cal
A}(\xi)\to {\cal A}(N,\xi)\colon\Gamma\mapsto\gamma,$ where
$\gamma$ is the projection of $\Gamma$ with respect to $p\colon
P\to N.$


%{\bf Definition 4.} 
\begin{Def}
Let $\xi=(P(N,H),\omega)$ be a rigid
structure on a manifold $N$ with the projection $p\colon P\to N.$
The group $\mathrm{Gauge}(\xi):=\{\Gamma\in{\cal A}(\xi)\mid
p\circ\Gamma=p\}$ is called a {\it group of gauge transformations
of the rigid structure} $\xi.$
\end{Def}

Remark that $\mathrm{Gauge}(\xi)$ is a closed normal Lie subgroup
of the group ${\cal A}(\xi)$, because it is the kernel of the
natural group epimorphism $\chi\colon{\cal A}(\xi)\to{\cal
A}(N,\xi).$

{\bf Effectiveness of rigid geometries.}


%{\bf Definition 5.} 
\begin{Def}
A rigid structure
$\xi=(P(N,H),\omega)$ is called {\it effective} if for an
arbitrary open subset $V$ in $N$ the induced rigid structure
$\xi_V=(P_V(V,H),\omega_V)$ has the trivial group of gauge
transformations, i.~e.,
$\mathrm{Gauge}(\xi_V)=\{\mathrm{id}_{P_V}\}.$ A rigid geometry
$(N,\xi)$ is said {\it to be effective} if $\xi$ is an effective
structure.
\end{Def}

{\bf Pseudogroup of local automorphisms.\,} Let $(N,\xi)$ be
a rigid geometry. For arbitrary open subsets $V,$ $V'\subset N$ an
isomorphism $V\to V'$ of the induced rigid geometries $(V,\xi_V)$
and $(V',\xi_{V'})$ is called a {\it local automorphism} of
$(N,\xi).$ The family ${\cal H}$ of all local automorphisms of a
rigid geometry $(N,\xi)$ forms a pseudogroup of local
automorphisms. Denote it by ${\cal H}={\cal H}(N,\xi).$ Recall
that a pseudogroup ${\cal H}$ of local diffeomorphisms of manifold
$N$ is called {\it quasi-analytic} if the existence of an open
subset $V\subset N$ and an element $\gamma\in{\cal H}$ such that
$\gamma|_V=\mathrm{id}_V$ implies that
$\gamma|_{D(\gamma)}=\mathrm{id}_{D(\gamma)}$ in the entire
(connected) domain ${D(\gamma)}$ on which $\gamma$ is defined.


%{\bf Proposition 1.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{The pseudogroup ${\cal H}={\cal
H}(N,\xi)$ of all local automorphisms of an effective rigid
geometry $(N,\xi)$ is quasi-analytic.}
\end{Proposition}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
  Let $\gamma$ be an element of ${\cal H}={\cal H}(N,\xi)$ such that
  $\gamma|_V=\mathrm{id}_V$ for some open subset $V$ in $N.$ The
  effectiveness of the rigid geometry $(N,\xi)$ implies
  $\Gamma=\mathrm{id}_{P_V},$ where $\Gamma$ is a local automorphism
  of $\xi$ having the projection~$\gamma|_V$ with respect to $p\colon
  P\to N.$ Let the domain $D=D(\gamma)$ of~$\gamma$ be an open
  connected subset of $N$ such that $D\setminus V\neq\emptyset.$
  Consider an automorphism $\tilde\Gamma$ of the induced rigid
  structure $\xi_D$ with the projection~$\gamma.$ Since
  $\tilde\Gamma^*\omega_D=\omega_D,$ $\tilde\Gamma$ is an isomorphism
  of the parallelizable manifold $(P_D,\omega_D).$ It is known that
  two automorphisms of a connected parallelizable manifold, which
  coincide at one point, coincide at any point.  Therefore it follows
  from the equality $\tilde\Gamma|_{P_V}=\Gamma=\mathrm{id}_{P_V}$
  that $\tilde\Gamma|_{CP_D}=\mathrm{id}_{CP_D}$ for each connected
  component $CP_D$ of $P_D.$ Thus, $\tilde\Gamma=\mathrm{id}_{P_D},$
  hence $\gamma=\mathrm{id}_D.$ %\qed

\section{Foliations with transverse rigid geometries. Foliated bundles}

{\bf Foliations with transverse rigid geometries (TRG).\,} A foliation
$(M,F)$ of codimension $q$ on an $n$-manifold $M$ has a transverse
rigid geometry $(N,\xi),$ where $N$ is a $q$-manifold, if $(M,F)$ is
defined by a cocycle $\eta=\{U_i,f_i,\{\gamma_{ij}\}\}$ modeled on
$(N,\xi),$ i.~e.,
\begin{itemize} 
\item[1)] $\{U_i\}$ is an open covering of $M;$
\item[2)] $f_i\colon U_i\to N$ are submersions with connected fibres;
\item[3)] $\gamma_{ij}\circ f_j=f_i$ on $U_i\cap U_j,$
\end{itemize} with $\gamma_{ij}$ is a local automorphism of $(N,\xi).$
The topological space $N$ is not assumed to be connected. Without loss
of generality, we will suppose that $N=\cup_{i\in J}f_i(U_i)$ and the
family $\{(U_i,f_i)\}$ is maximal as it is generally used in manifold
theory.

Let $\Sigma$ be the set of fibres of the submersions $f_i$ belonging
to the cocycle $\eta.$ One can easily check that $\Sigma$ is a base of
a certain topology $\tau$ in $M.$ The connected components of the
topological space $(M,\tau)$ form a partition $F=\{ L_\alpha |~ \alpha
\in A\}.$


%{\bf Definition 6.} 
\begin{Def}
We call $(M,F),$ where $F$ is the
partition mentioned above, a {\it foliation with transverse rigid
geometry} $(N,\xi),$ and $L_\alpha$ are called its {\it leaves.}
The cocycle $\eta$ modelled on $(N,\xi)$ is said to be an {\it
$(N,\xi)$-cocycle.}
\end{Def}

Let $(M,F)$ be a foliation defined by an $(N,\xi)$-cocycle
$\eta=\{U_i,f_i,\{\gamma_{ij}\}\},$ where $(N,\xi)$ is an
effective rigid geometry. Effectiveness of $\xi$ guarantees the
existence of a unique isomorphism $\Gamma_{ij}$ of the induced
rigid structures $\xi_{f_j(U_i\cap U_j)}$ and $\xi_{f_i(U_i\cap
U_j)}$, whose projection  coincides with $\gamma_{ij}$. Hence, in
the case $U_i\cap U_j\cap U_k\neq\emptyset,$ the equality
$\gamma_{ij}\circ\gamma_{jk}=\gamma_{ik}$ implies the equality
\begin{itemize} 
\item[$(\Gamma_1)$] $\Gamma_{ij}\circ\Gamma_{jk}=\Gamma_{ik}.$
\end{itemize}

The following two equalities are direct corollaries of the
effectiveness of $\eta$ and~$(\Gamma_1):$
\begin{itemize} \item[$(\Gamma_2)$] $\Gamma_{ii}=\mathrm{id}_{P_i}$
  \quad and \quad $(\Gamma_3)$ $\Gamma_{ij}=(\Gamma_{ji})^{-1}.$
\end{itemize}

{\bf Assumptions.\,} {\it In this work we will assume
that each rigid geometry is effective and all the foliations under
consideration are modeled on effective rigid geometries.}

{\bf Notations.\,} We denote by $\frak X(N)$ the Lie algebra of
smooth vector fields on a manifold $N.$ If $Q$ is a smooth
distribution on $M,$ then $\frak X_Q(M):=\{X\in\frak X(M)\mid
X_u\in Q_u,\,\forall u\in M\}.$ If $Q$ is an integrable
distribution and defines a foliation $F,$ where $Q=TF,$ we also
use notation $\frak X_F(M)$ for $\frak X_Q(M).$

{\bf Foliated bundles.} Now we construct the
foliated bundle for a foliation with TRG.


%{\bf Theorem 1.} 
\begin{Theorem}
{Let $(M,F)$ be a foliation with a
transverse rigid geometry $(N,\xi),$ where $\xi=(P(N,H),\omega).$
Then there exist a principal $H$-bundle $\pi\colon{\cal R}\to M,$
an $H$-invariant foliation $({\cal R},{\cal F})$ whose leaves are
projected by $\pi$ onto the leaves of $(M,F)$ and an
$\mathbb{R}^m$-valued 1-form $\tilde\omega$ on $\cal R,$ where
$m=\dim P,$ that satisfy the following conditions:
\begin{itemize} 
%\item[(i)] 
\item[] (i) the map $\tilde\omega_u\colon T_u({\cal
    R})\to\mathbb{R}^m,$ $\forall u\in\cal R,$ is surjective;
  moreover, $\ker\tilde\omega_u= T_u\cal F;$ 
%\item[(ii)] 
\item[] (ii) there is an inclusion $\frak h\subset \mathbb{R}^m$ of the
  vector space of the Lie algebra $\frak h$ of the Lie group $H$ into
  $\mathbb{R}^m$ such that $\tilde\omega(A^*)=A,$ $\forall A\in\frak
  h,$ where $A^*$ is the fundamental vector field on ${\cal R}$
  corresponding to $A;$ 
%\item[(iii)] 
\item[] (iii) the foliation $({\cal R},{\cal F})$ is an
  $e$-foliation; 
%\item[(iv)] 
\item[] (iv) the restriction $\pi_{\cal L}$ on an arbitrary leaf ${\cal
    L}$ of the foliation $({\cal R},{\cal F})$ is a regular covering
  map onto a leaf of $(M,F),$ and the subgroup $H({\cal L}):=\{a\in
  H\mid R_a({\cal L})={\cal L}\}$ of the Lie group $H$ is the group of
  deck transformations.
\end{itemize} 
}
\end{Theorem}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
Supppose that the foliation $(M,F)$ with
transverse rigid geometry is defined by a $(N,\xi)$-cocycle
$\{U_i,f_i,\{\gamma_{ij}\}\},$ where $\xi=(P(N,H),\omega),$ and
let $p\colon P\to N$ be  the projection of the principal
$H$-bundle $P(N,H).$ Denote $V_i:=f_i(U_i),$ $P_i:=p^{-1}(V_i)$
and $p_i:=p|_{P_i}.$ Without loss of generality, we can assume
that $U_i$ and $V_i$ are contractible open sets. Let ${\cal
R}_i:=f_i^*P_i:=\{(x,z)\in U_i\times P_i\mid f_i(x)=p_i(z)\},$
$\bar f_i\colon {\cal R}_i\to P_i\colon (x,z)\mapsto z$ and
$\pi_i\colon {\cal R}_i\to U_i\colon (x,z)\mapsto x,$ $\forall
(x,z)\in {\cal R}_i.$ We have $p_i\circ\bar f_i=f_i\circ\pi_i.$
The formula $(x,z)\cdot a:=(x,z\cdot a),$ $\forall (x,z)\in {\cal
R}_i,$ $\forall a\in H,$ defines a right action of the group $H$
on ${\cal R}_i.$ Thus we have the principal $H$-bundle
$\pi_i\colon {\cal R}_i\to U_i$ with the simple $H$-invariant
foliation ${\cal F}_i=\{\bar f_i^{-1}(z)\mid z\in P_i\}.$ Let
$\omega_i:=\omega|_{P_i}.$ We have the $\mathbb{R}^m$-valued
1-form $\bar\omega_i:=\bar f_i^*\omega_i$ defined on ${\cal R}_i$.
Moreover, $\bar\omega_i(X)=0$ for $X\in\frak X({\cal R}_i)$ if and
only if $X\in {\frak X}_{{\cal F}_i}({\cal R}_i).$

Let $Y:=\bigsqcup_{i\in J} {\cal R}_i$ be the disjunct union of
the manifolds ${\cal R}_i.$ Let us introduce an equivalence
relation $\rho$ in $Y.$ Denote a point $u\in Y\cap {\cal R}_i$ by
the pair $(i,u).$ Two points $(i,u)$ and $(j,w)$ in $Y$ are said
to be $\rho$-equivalent if 
\begin{itemize} 
\item[](1)
$\pi_i(u)=\pi_j(w)\in U_i\cap U_j;$ 
\item[](2) 
$\bar
f_i(u)=(\Gamma_{ij}\circ\bar f_j)(w),$ 
\end{itemize}
where $\Gamma_{ij}$ is the
isomorphism of the rigid structures $\xi_{f_j(U_i\cap U_j)}$ and
$\xi_{f_i(U_i\cap U_j)}$ whose projection $\gamma_{ij}$ belongs to
the $(N,\xi)$-cocycle $\{U_i,f_i,\{\gamma_{ij}\}\}.$

The above equality $(\Gamma_2)$ implies that $\rho$ is reflexive.
The relation $(\Gamma_3)$ guarantees the symmetry of $\rho,$ while
the relation $(\Gamma_1)$ implies the transitivity of $\rho.$ Thus
$\rho$ is indeed an equivalence relation in $Y.$ Hence we have the
quotient space ${\cal R}:=Y/\rho,$ the quotient mapping
$\varphi\colon Y\to{\cal R}$ and the surjective projection
$\pi\colon{\cal R}\to M$, where $\pi$ maps the equivalence class
$[(i,u)]\in{\cal R}$ of a point $(i,u)\in Y$ to the point
$\pi_i(u)\in M.$ The restriction $\varphi_i:=\varphi|_{{\cal
R}_i}\colon{\cal R}_i\to{\cal R}$ is injective. Therefore
$\varphi_i$ is a bijective map onto image $\tilde
U_i:=\varphi({\cal R}_i);$ it will be denoted by
$\varphi_i\colon{\cal R}_i\to\tilde U_i.$ A smooth structure in
${\cal R}$ is well defined by assuming that each bijection
$\varphi_i$ is a diffeomorphism of ${\cal R}_i$ and~$\tilde U_i.$

Let $x$ be any point in ${\cal R}$ and $\tilde U_i\ni x.$ Set
$x\cdot a:=\varphi_i^{-1}(x)\cdot a,$ $\forall a\in H.$ This
definition does not depend on the choice of $\tilde U_i$
containing $x$ because all $\Gamma_{ij}$ are isomorphisms of the
corresponding principal $H$-bundles. Thus ${\cal R}$ becomes the
total space of the principal $H$-bundle. The quotient manifold
${\cal R}/H$ can be identified with the manifold $M,$ while the
projection onto the quotient can be identified with
$\pi\colon{\cal R}\to M.$

Define an 1-form $\tilde\omega$ on ${\cal R}$ by the formula
$\tilde\omega|_{\tilde U_i}:=(\varphi_i^{-1})^*\bar\omega_i.$ If
$U_i\cap U_j\neq\emptyset,$ then $\tilde U_i\cap \tilde
U_j\neq\emptyset$ and $\Gamma^*_{ij}\omega_i=\omega_j$ because
$\Gamma_{ij}$ is an isomorphism of the respective rigid
structures, which lies over the local automorphism $\gamma_{ij}$
of $(N,\xi).$ Since $\bar\omega_i=\bar f_i^*\omega_i,$ we have the
equality
$(\varphi_i^{-1})^*\bar\omega_i=(\varphi_j^{-1})^*\bar\omega_j$ on
$\tilde U_i\cap\tilde U_j.$  Thus the 1-form $\tilde\omega$ is
well defined.

The foliations ${\cal F}_i$ on ${\cal R}_i$ and hence the
foliations $(\varphi_i)_*{\cal F}_i$ on $\tilde U_i$ are glued
together by $\rho$ into a foliation ${\cal F}$ on the manifold
${\cal R}$ such that ${\cal F}|_{\tilde U_i}=(\varphi_i)_*{\cal
F}_i.$ It follows from the definition of $\tilde\omega$ that
$\tilde\omega(X)=0$ for $X\in\frak X({\cal R})$ if and only if
$X\in {\frak X}_{\cal F}({\cal R}).$

The invariance of the foliations ${\cal F}_i,$ $i\in J,$ with
respect to the action of the group~$H$ implies the $H$-invariance
of the foliation ${\cal F}$ on ${\cal R}.$

The equality $\tilde\omega(A^*)=A,$ $\forall A\in\frak h,$ is a
consequence of the equality $(S)$ for $\omega$ and the definitions
of the principal $H$-bundle $\pi\colon{\cal R}\to M$ with the
1-form $\tilde\omega.$

We emphasize that the $(P,\omega)$-cocycle $\{\tilde U_i,\tilde
f_i,\{\Gamma_{ij}\}\}$ defines the foliation $({\cal R},{\cal
F}).$ Thus $({\cal R},{\cal F})$ is an $e$-foliation.

From the construction of the foliation $({\cal R},{\cal F})$ it
follows that the restriction $\pi|_{\cal L}$ onto an arbitrary
leaf ${\cal L}$ of $({\cal R},{\cal F})$ is a covering mapping
onto some leaf $L$ of the foliation $(M,F).$ Fix a point $x\in L$
and a point $u\in{\cal L}\cap\pi^{-1}(x).$ For any point
$u'\in{\cal L}\cap\pi^{-1}(x)$ there exists a unique element $b\in
H$ such that $u'=u\cdot b.$ Invariance of the lifted foliation
$({\cal R},{\cal F})$ with respect to the action of the Lie group
$H$ implies that $R_b({\cal L})={\cal L},$ hence $b\in H({\cal
L}):=\{a\in H\mid R_a({\cal L})={\cal L}\}.$ Thus the subgroup
$H({\cal L})$ of the group $H$ acts transitively on the set ${\cal
L}\cap\pi^{-1}(x),$ with $L={\cal L}/H({\cal L}).$ Therefore the
covering mapping $\pi|_{\cal L}\colon{\cal L}\to L$ is regular,
and $H({\cal L})$ is its deck transformation group.

%{\bf Definition 7.} 
\begin{Def}
The principal $H$-bundle ${\cal
R}(M,H)$ with the $H$-invariant foliation $({\cal R},{\cal F})$
constructed in the proof of Theorem~1 is called {\it the foliated
bundle for the foliation $(M,F)$ with transverse rigid geometry}
$(N,\xi)$ and $({\cal R},{\cal F})$ is called {\it the lifted
foliation.}
\end{Def}

%{\bf Remark 1.} 
\begin{Remark}
The lifted $e$-foliation $({\cal R},{\cal
F})$ is defined by $(P,\omega)$-cocycle $\{\tilde U_i,\tilde
f_i,\{\Gamma_{ij}\}\}.$
\end{Remark}

%{\bf Remark 2.} 
\begin{Remark}
If $H$ is disconnected, ${\cal R}$ may be
also disconnected. In this case  all the connected components of
${\cal R}$ are mutually diffeomorphic, and we will consider one of
them. Thus, we assume that the space of the foliated bundle ${\cal
R}$ is connected.

\section{Completeness and a structure Lie algebra  of a foliation with TRG}

{\bf Completeness of foliations with TRG.\,} Let $(M,F)$
be an arbitrary smooth foliation on a manifold $M$ and $TF$ be the
distribution on $M$ formed by the vector spaces tangent to the
leaves of the foliation $F.$ The vector quotient bundle $TM/TF$ is
called the transverse vector bundle of the foliation $(M,F).$ Let
us identify $TM/TF$ with an arbitrary smooth distribution $\frak
M$ on $M$ that is transverse to the foliation $(M,F),$ i.~e., $TM
= TF\oplus\frak M.$

Let $(M,F)$ be a foliation with TRG and $({\cal R},{\cal F})$ be
the lifted foliation. It is natural to identify the transverse
vector bundle $T{\cal R}/T{\cal F}$ with a distribution
$\overline{\frak M}:=\pi^*\frak M$ on ${\cal R},$ i.~e., with a
distribution defined by the equality $\overline{{\frak M}}_u:=
\{X_u\in T_u{\cal R} \mid$ $\pi_*X_u\in{\frak M}_x\},$ where $x =
\pi(u)$ and $u\in\cal R.$


%{\bf Definition 8.} 
\begin{Def}
A foliation $(M,F)$ with transverse
rigid geometry is said to be {\it $\frak M$-complete} if any
transverse vector field $X\in {\frak X}_{\overline{\frak M}}({\cal
R})$ such that $\tilde\omega(X) = \mathrm{const}$ is complete. A
foliation $(M,F)$ with TRG of arbitrary codimension $q$ is said to
be {\it complete} if there exists a smooth $q$-dimensional
transverse distribution $\frak M$ on  $M$ such that $(M,F)$ is
$\frak M$-complete.
\end{Def}


%{\bf Remark 3.} 
\begin{Remark}
In other words, $(M,F)$ is an $\frak
M$-complete foliation iff the lifted $e$-foliation $({\cal
R},{\cal F})$ is complete with respect to the distribution
$\overline{\frak M}$ in the sense of Conlon~\cite{Con}. Remark that a
complete $e$-foliation in the sense of Conlon is also complete in
the sense of Molino~\cite{Mol_book}.
\end{Remark}

{\bf Ehresmann connections for foliations.\,}
Let $(M,F)$ be a foliation of codimension $q$ and $\frak M$ be a
smooth $q$-dimensional distribution on $M$ that is transverse to
the foliation $F.$ The piecewise smooth integral curves of the
distribution $\frak M$ are said to be {\it horizontal,} and the
piecewise smooth curves in the leaves are said to be vertical. A
piecewise smooth mapping $H$ of the square $I_1\times I_2$ to $M$
is called a {\it vertical-horizontal homotopy} if the curve
$H|_{{s}\times I_2}$ is vertical for any $s\in I_1$ and the curve
$H|_{I_1\times{t}}$ is horizontal for any $t\in I_2.$ In this
case, the pair of paths $(H|_{I_1\times \{0\}},H|_{\{0\}\times
I_2})$  is called the {\it base} of $H.$ It is well known that
there exists at most one vertical-horizontal homotopy with a given
base. A distribution $\frak M$ is called an {\it Ehresmann
connection for a foliation} $(M,F)$ (in the sense of Blumenthal
and Hebda~\cite{BH}) if, for any pair of paths $(\sigma, h)$ in $M$ with
a common starting point $\sigma(0) = h(0),$ where $\sigma$ is a
horizontal curve and $h$ is a vertical curve, there exists a
vertical-horizontal homotopy $H$ with the base $(\sigma, h).$ If
the distribution $\frak M$ is integrable, then the connection is
said to be {\it integrable.} For a simple foliation $F,$ i.~e.,
such that it is formed by the fibers of a submersion $r\colon M\to
B,$ a distribution $\frak M$ is an Ehresmann connection for $F$ if
and only if $\frak M$ is an Ehresmann connection for the
submersion $r,$ i.~e., if and only if any smooth curve in $B$
possesses horizontal lifts.


%{\bf Proposition 2.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{ If $(M,F)$ is an $\frak
M$-complete foliation with TRG, then $\frak M$ is an Ehresmann
connection for this foliation. }
\end{Proposition}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
The distribution $\overline{\frak
M}:=\pi^*\frak M$ is an Ehresmann connection for the lifted
foliation $({\cal R,F}),$ because $(M,F)$ is $\frak M$-complete.
So in view of $F=\pi_*{\cal F}$ and $\frak M=\pi_*\overline{\frak
M},$ we see that $\frak M$ is an Ehresmann connection for
$(M,F).$
%\qed
\end{proof}

{\bf Structure Lie algebra.\,}
Applying of the relevant results of Molino~\cite{Mol_book} on complete
$e$-foliations, we obtain the following theorem.


%{\bf Theorem 2.} 
\begin{Theorem}
{Let $(M,F)$ be a complete foliation
with TRG and $({\cal R},{\cal F})$ be its lifted $e$-foliation.
Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] (i) the closure of the leaves of the foliation
$\cal F$ are fibers of a certain locally trivial fibration
$\pi_b\colon{\cal R}\to W;$ 
\item[] (ii) the foliation
$(\overline{\cal L},{\cal F}|_{\overline{\cal L}})$ induced on the
closure $\overline{\cal L}$ is a Lie foliation with dense leaves
with the structure Lie algebra $\frak g_0$, that is the same for
any $\cal L\in\cal F.$
\end{itemize} }
\end{Theorem}

%{\bf Definition 9.} 
\begin{Def}
The structure Lie algebra $\frak g_0$
of the Lie foliation $(\overline{\cal L},{\cal F}|_{\overline{\cal
L}})$ is called {\it the structure Lie algebra} of the complete
foliation $(M,F)$ and is denoted by $\frak g_0=\frak g_0(M,F).$
\end{Def}


%{\bf Remark 4.} 
\begin{Remark}
If $(M,F)$ is a Riemannian foliation on a
compact manifold, this notion coincides with the notion of a
structure Lie algebra in the sense of Molino~\cite{Mol_book}.
\end{Remark}


%{\bf Definition 10.} 
\begin{Def}
The fibration $\pi_b\colon{\cal
R}\to W$ satisfying Theorem 2 is called a {\it basic fibration}
for $(M,F).$
\end{Def}

%\begin{center}{\large\bf 4. Category of foliations with TRG}\end{center}

\section{Category of foliations with TRG}

{\bf Category of foliations.\,} Denote by ${\frak F\frak
o\frak l}$ the category of foliations, objects of which are
foliations, morphisms of two arbitrary foliations $(M,F)$ and
$(M',F')$ are smooth maps $M \to M'$ mapping leaves of the
foliation $(M,F)$ into leaves of the foliation $(M',F');$ a
composition of morphisms coincides with the composition of maps.

{\bf Category of foliations with TRG.\,}
Let $(M,F)$ and $(M',F')$ are foliations with transverse rigid
geometries $(N,\xi)$ and $(N',\xi')$ defined by an
$(N,\xi)$-cocycle $\eta=\{U_i,f_i, \{\gamma _{ij}\}\}$ and an
$(N',\xi')$-cocycle $\eta'=\{U'_r,f'_r, \{\gamma'_{rs}\}\},$
respectively. Let $f\colon M\to M'$ be a morphism which is a local
isomorphism in the category ${\frak F\frak o\frak l}.$

Hence for any $x\in M$ and $y:=f(x)$ there exist neighborhoods $U_k\ni
x$ and $U'_k\ni y$ from $\eta$ and $\eta'$ respectively and a
diffeomorphism $\lambda\colon V_k\to V'_s,$ where $V_k:=f_k(U_k)$ and
$V'_s:=f'_s(U'_s),$ satisfying the relations $f(U_k)=U'_s$ and
$\lambda\circ f_k=f'_s\circ f|_{U_k}.$ We will say that $f$ preserves
{\it transverse rigid structure} if the diffeomorphism $\lambda\colon
V_k\to V'_s$ is an isomorphism of the induced rigid geometries
$(V_k,\xi_{V_k})$ and $(V'_s,\xi'_{V'_s}).$

This notion is well defined, i.~e., it does not depend of the
choice of neighborhoods~$U_k$ and $U'_k$ from the cocycles $\eta$
and $\eta'.$

By a {\it TRG-morphism of two foliations $(M,F)$ and $(M',F')$
with transverse rigid geometries} we mean a morphism $f\colon M\to
M'$ in the category ${\frak F\frak o\frak l}$ which preserves
transverse rigid structure. The category $\mathfrak{F}_{TRG}$
objects of which are foliations with TRG, morphisms are
TRG-morphisms, is called {\it the category of foliations with
transverse rigid geometries.}

{\bf Isomorphisms in the category ${\frak F}_{TRG}$.\,}
Remark that for any $e$-foliation $({\cal R,F})$ the lifted
foliation coincides with $({\cal R,F}).$ Using this we easily get
the following lemma.


%{\bf Lemma 1.} 
\begin{Lemma}
{Let $({\cal R,F})$ and $({\cal
R',F'})$  be  two $e$-foliations with transverse rigid geometries
 $(P,\omega)$ and $(P',\omega')$ respectively, where
  $(P,\omega)$ and $(P',\omega')$ are parallelizable manifolds.
  Let $\tilde\omega$ and $\tilde\omega'$ be the basic 1-forms on $\cal R$ and
  $\cal R'$ defined according to Theorem 1. Then a diffeomorphism
  $f\colon{\cal R}\to{\cal R'}$ is an isomorphism in the category
${\frak F}_{TRG}$ if and only if $f$ is an isomorphism in the
category $\frak F\frak o\frak l$ and
$f^*\tilde\omega'=\tilde\omega.$ }
\end{Lemma}

%{\bf Proposition 3.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{ Let $(M,F)$ and $(M',F')$ be
two foliations with TRG, let $({\cal R,F})$ and $({\cal R',F'})$
be the corresponding lifted foliations. Then a diffeomorphism
$f\colon M\to M'$ is an isomorphism in the category ${\frak
F}_{TRG}$ if and only if there exists an isomorphism $\hat
f\colon{\cal R}\to{\cal R'}$ of the lifted foliations in the
category ${\frak F}_{TRG}$ such that $R'_a\circ\hat f=\hat f\circ
R_a,$ $\forall a\in H,$ where $R_a,$ $R'_a$ are the right
translations by an element $a\in H$ on $\cal R$ and $\cal R'$
accordingly. }
\end{Proposition}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
We will use the notations introduced in the
proof of Theorem 1. Let the foliation with TRG $(M,F)$ is defined
by an $(N,\xi)$-cocycle $\eta=\{U_i,f_i,\{\gamma_{ij}\}\}.$ Recall
that the lifted foliation $({\cal R,F})$ is defined by a
$(P,\omega)$-cocycle $\tilde\eta=\{\tilde U_i,\tilde
f_i,\{\Gamma_{ij}\}\},$ where $\tilde U_i:=\pi^{-1}(U_i),$ and the
local isomorphisms $\Gamma_{ij}$ of the rigid structure $\xi$ lie
over the local isomorphisms $\gamma_{ij}$ of the rigid geometry
$(N,\xi).$ For the objects, concerning to the foliation $(M',F')$,
we will use primes.

At first, suppose that $\hat f\colon{\cal R}\to{\cal R'}$ is an
isomorphism of the $e$-foliations $({\cal R,F})$ and $({\cal
R',F'})$ satisfying the condition $R'_a\circ\hat f=\hat f\circ
R_a,$ $\forall a\in H.$ Then the projection $f\colon M\to M'$ of
$\hat f$ is well defined by the equality $\pi'\circ\hat f=
f\circ\pi,$ where $\pi\colon{\cal R}\to M$ and $\pi'\colon{\cal
R'}\to M'$ are the projections of the foliated bundles.

Consider an arbitrary point $x\in M$ and $y:=f(x)\in M'.$ There
are neighborhoods $U_k\ni x$ and $U'_s\ni y$ from the
$(N,\xi)$-cocycle and the $(N',\xi')$-cocycle defining the
foliations $(M,F)$ and $(M',F')$ respectively, with $f(U_k)=U'_s.$
Then $\hat f(\tilde U_k)=\tilde U'_s$.  The lifted $e$-foliations
$(\tilde U_k,{\cal F}|_{\tilde U_k})$ and $(\tilde U'_s,{\cal
F'}|_{\tilde U'_s})$ are defined by the submersions $\tilde
f_k\colon\tilde U_k\to P_k$ and $\tilde f'_s\colon\tilde U'_s\to
P'_s$ accordingly. Besides, $R'_a\circ\hat f=\hat f\circ R_a,$
$\forall a \in H.$ Hence, according to Lemma~1, a diffeomorphism
$\Gamma\colon P_k\to P'_s$ defined by the relation
$\Gamma\circ\tilde f_k=\tilde f'_s\circ\hat f|_{\tilde U'_s}$ is a
local isomorphism of the rigid structures $\xi$ and $\xi'.$ Put
$V_k=f_k(U_k)$ and $V'_s=f'_s(U'_s).$ Let $\gamma\colon V_k\to
V'_s$ be the projection of $\Gamma,$ then $\gamma$ is an
isomorphism of the rigid geometries induced on $V_k$ and $V'_s.$
Thus, $f$ is an isomorphism of the foliations $(M,F)$ and
$(M',F')$ in the category~${\frak F}_{TRG}.$

Converse, suppose that $f\colon M\to M'$ is an isomorphism of the
foliations $(M,F)$ and $(M',F')$ in the category ${\frak
F}_{TRG}.$ Construct $\hat f\colon{\cal R}\to{\cal R'}$ in the
following way. Let $x$ be any point in $M$ and $y:=f(x)\in M'.$
Let $U_k\ni x$ and $U'_s\ni y$ be neighborhoods from the cocycles
$\eta$ and $\eta'$ respectively, with $f(U_k)=U'_s.$ Consider
${\cal R}_k:=f_k^*(P_k),$ where $P_k=\tilde f_k(\tilde U_k).$ Then
${\cal R}_k=\{(x,z)\in U_k\times P_k\mid f_k(x)=p_k(z)\},$ ${\cal
R'}_s$ is defined similarly. Since $f$ is an isomorphism in the
category ${\frak F}_{TRG},$ by definition, there exists a
diffeomorphism $\gamma\colon V_k\to V'_s$ which is an isomorphism
of the induced rigid geometries $(V_k,\xi_{V_k})$ and
$(V'_s,\xi'_{V'_s}),$ and $\gamma\circ f_k=f'_s\circ f|_{U_k}.$

Since the rigid geometries $(N,\xi)$ and $(N',\xi')$ are
effective, there is a unique isomorphism $\Gamma\colon P_k\to
P'_s$ of the induced rigid structures $\xi_{V_k}$ and
$\xi'_{V'_s}$ with the projection~$\gamma.$ Then
$\Gamma^*\omega'=\omega$ and $\Gamma\circ R_a=R'_a\circ\Gamma,$
$\forall a\in H.$ Define a map $h\colon{\cal R}_k\to{\cal R'}_s$
by the equality $$h(x,z):=(f(x),\Gamma(z)),\quad\forall
(x,z)\in{\cal R}_k.$$

According to the definition of the foliated bundle for $(M,F),$
the bijections $\varphi_i\colon{\cal R}_i\to\tilde U_i$ are
isomorphisms of the simple foliations with TRG defined by the
submersions $\bar f_i\colon {\cal R}_i\to P_i$ and $\tilde
f_i\colon\tilde U_i\to P_i$ respectively. An analogous assertion
holds for the foliation $(M',F')$. Hence $h\colon{\cal
R}_k\to{\cal R'}_s$ is an isomorphism of the foliations mentioned
above in the category~${\frak F}_{TRG}.$

Put, by definition, $\hat f|_{\tilde U_k}:=\varphi'_s\circ
h\circ\varphi^{-1}_k$ for any neighborhood $\tilde U_k$ from the
cocycle~$\eta.$ It is not difficult to check that this equality
defines the map $\hat f\colon{\cal R}\to{\cal R'},$ where $\hat f$
satisfies the following conditions: $(i)\; \hat
f^*\tilde\omega'=\tilde\omega$ and $(ii)\; R'_a\circ\hat f=\hat
f\circ R_a,$ $\forall a\in H.$ Therefore, by Lemma 1, $\hat f$ is
an isomorphism of the lifted $e$-foliations satisfying~(ii). 
%\qed
\end{proof}

%{\bf Proposition 4.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{Let $(M,F)$ and $(M',F')$ be
two foliations with transverse rigid geometries $(N,\xi)$ and
$(N'\xi')$ accordingly. Let $\hat f_1$ and $\hat f_2\colon{\cal
R}\to{\cal R'}$ be two isomorphisms of $({\cal R,F})$ and  $({\cal
R',F'})$ satisfying the equalities $R'_a\circ\hat f_i=\hat
f_i\circ R_a,$ $i=1,2,$ $\forall a\in H.$ If their projections
$h_i\colon M\to M'$ coincide:  $h_1=h_2,$ then  $\hat f_1=\hat
f_2.$ }
\end{Proposition}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
The map $\hat f:=\hat f_2^{-1}\circ\hat
f_1\colon{\cal R}\to{\cal R}$ is an isomorphism of $({\cal R,F})$
satisfying the relation $R'_a\circ\hat f=\hat f\circ R_a,$
$\forall a\in H,$ where the projection of $\hat f$ is
$f=h_2^{-1}\circ h_1=\mathrm{id}_M.$ For any $x\in M$ we have
$y=f(x)=x$. Therefore, we can take $U_s=U_k\ni x$ in the
definition of morphisms of the category ${\frak F}_{TRG}$. Then we
have $\tilde U_k=\tilde U_s.$ As above, let $f_k\colon U_k\to V_k$
be a submersion from the cocycle defining $(M,F)$ and
$p_k:=p|_{P_k}$. Then $\gamma=\mathrm{id}_{V_k}$ and $\Gamma\circ
p_k=p_k,$ where $\Gamma\colon P_k\to P_k$ is an automorphism of
the induced rigid structure $\xi_{V_k}=(P_k(H,V_k),\omega_k).$
Therefore $\Gamma\in\mathrm{Gauge}(\xi_{V_k}).$ Due to the
effectiveness of the transverse rigid geometry $(N,\xi),$ we
necessarily have $\Gamma=\mathrm{id}_{P_k}.$ The equality
$\Gamma\circ\tilde f_k=\tilde f_k\circ\hat f|_{\tilde U_k}$
implies $\tilde f_k=\tilde f_k\circ\hat f|_{\tilde U_k},$ i.~e.,
$\hat f|_{\tilde U_k}\in{\cal A}^H_L(\tilde U_k,{\cal F}|_{\tilde
U_k}).$ For any $x\in M$, the neighborhoods $\{U_k\mid x\in U_k\}$
from the $(N,\xi)$-cocycle $\eta=\{U_i,f_i,\{\gamma_{ij}\}\}$ form
a base of the topology of the manifold $M$ at $x.$ Hence $\hat
f(u)=u,$ $\forall u\in\pi^{-1}(x).$ Since $x$ is an arbitrary
point in $M,$ we have $\hat f=\mathrm{id}_{\cal R}.$ Thus, $\hat
f_1=\hat f_2.$ 
%\qed
\end{proof}

{\bf A foliated natural functor.\,} By analogy to
Proposition~3 and~4 it is not difficult to prove that for any
morphism $f\colon M\to M'$ of foliations $(M,F)$ and $(M,F')$ in
the category ${\frak F}_{TRG}$ there exists a unique morphism
$\hat f\colon{\cal R}\to{\cal R'}$ of the lifted foliations
$({\cal R,F})$ and $({\cal R',F'})$ satisfying the equality
$R'_a\circ\hat f=\hat f\circ R_a$ $\forall a\in H.$ Set
$\Phi(M,F):=({\cal R,F})$ and $\Phi(f):=\hat f,$ then we get a
covariant functor $\Phi$ from the category ${\frak F}_{TRG}$ to
the category of foliated bundles. This functor is a foliated
natural bundle in sense of Wolak~\cite{Wol},~\cite[Chapter II]{Wol_book}.

{\bf Automorphism groups of foliations with TRG.\,}
Let $(M,F)$ be a foliation with a fixed transverse rigid structure
$(N,\xi).$ Denote by ${\cal A}(M,F)$ the group of all
automorphisms of $(M,F)$ in the category $\mathfrak{F}_{TRG}.$ We
say also that ${\cal A}(M,F)$ is the {\it full group of
automorphisms.}


%{\bf Theorem 3.} 
\begin{Theorem}
{Let $(M,F)$ be a foliation with
TRG. Let $(\cal R,F)$ be the lifted foliation and ${\cal
A}^H({\cal R,F})=\{f\in{\cal A}({\cal R,F})\mid f\circ
R_a=R_a\circ f,\quad\forall a\in H\}.$ Then the map
$\mu\colon{\cal A}^H({\cal R,F})\to{\cal A}(M,F)\colon\hat
f\mapsto f,$ where $f$ is the projection of $\hat f\in{\cal
A}^H({\cal R,F})$ with respect to $\pi\colon{\cal R}\to M,$ is a
natural group isomorphism. }
\end{Theorem}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
By Proposition~3, the map $\mu$ is well
defined and surjective. It is clear that $\mu$ is a group
homomorphism. According to Proposition~4, $\mu$ is injective.
Thus, $\mu$ is a group isomorphism. 
%\qed
\end{proof}

%{\bf Remark 5.} 
\begin{Remark}
Due to Theorem 3, problems concerning to
automorphism groups of foliations with TRG are reduced to the
analogous problems for automorphism groups of the lifted
$e$-foliations.
\end{Remark}

{\bf Invariance of the structure Lie algebra.\,}
The following statement shows that the structure Lie algebra
$\frak g_0(M,F)$ of a foliation $(M,F)$ with TRG is an invariant
in the category~${\frak F}_{TRG}.$


%{\bf Proposition 5.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{Let $(M,F)$ and $(M',F')$ be
two foliations with TRG isomorphic in the category ${\frak
F}_{TRG}.$ Then their structure Lie algebras $\frak g_0(M,F)$ and
$\frak g_0(M',F')$ are isomorphic.}
\end{Proposition}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
Let $({\cal R,F})$ and $({\cal R',F'})$ be
the lifted foliations for  $(M,F)$ and $(M',F')$ respectively.
Suppose that there exists an isomorphism $f\colon M\to M'$ of the
foliations  $(M,F)$ and $(M',F')$ in ${\frak F}_{TRG}.$ Then by
Proposition~3 there exists a map $\hat f\colon{\cal R}\to{\cal
R'}$ which is an isomorphism of $({\cal R,F})$ and $({\cal
R',F'}).$ Let $\cal L$ be an arbitrary leaf of $({\cal R,F}),$
then ${\cal L'}=\hat f({\cal L})$ is a leaf of $({\cal R',F'}).$
Since $\hat f$ is a homeomorphism, $\hat f$ maps the closure
$\overline{\cal L}$ of $\cal L$ onto the closure $\overline{\cal
L'}$ of $\cal L'$, i.~e., $\hat f(\overline{\cal
L})=\overline{\cal L'}.$ Thus, $\hat f|_{\overline{\cal
L}}\colon\overline{\cal L}\to\overline{\cal L'}$ is an isomorphism
of the induced Lie foliations $(\overline{\cal L},{\cal
F}|_{\overline{\cal L}})$ and $(\overline{\cal L'},{\cal
F'}|_{\overline{\cal L'}})$ with dense leaves. It is known~\cite{Mol_book}
that the structure Lie algebra of a Lie foliation with dense
leaves is an invariant in the category of foliations $\frak F\frak
o\frak l.$ Therefore the Lie algebras $\frak g_0(\overline{\cal
L},{\cal F}|_{\overline{\cal L}})$ and $\frak g_0(\overline{\cal
L'},{\cal F'}|_{\overline{\cal L'}})$ are isomorphic. By
definition $\frak g_0(M,F)=\frak g_0(\overline{\cal L},{\cal
F}|_{\overline{\cal L}})$ and $\frak g_0(M',F')=\frak
g_0(\overline{\cal L'},{\cal F'}|_{\overline{\cal L'}}),$ hence
the Lie algebras $\frak g_0(M,F)$ and $\frak g_0(M',F')$ are
isomorphic. 
%\qed
\end{proof}

\section{Different interpretations of holonomy groups}

{\bf Holonomy groups of foliations with Ehresmann
connections.\,} Let $(M,F)$ be a foliation with an Ehresmann
connection $\frak M$ (see Section~3). Let $\Omega_x$ be the set of
horizontal curves with an initial point $x.$ It is not difficult
to prove that the map $\Phi_x\colon\Omega_x\times\pi_1(L,x)\to
\Omega_x\colon(\sigma,[h])\mapsto\tilde\sigma,$ where
$[h]\in\pi_1(L,x),$ $H$ is a vertical-horizontal homotopy with the
base $(\sigma,h),$ and $\tilde\sigma(s):=H(s,1),$ $s\in I_1,$
defines a right action of the fundamental group $\pi_1(L,x)$ of
the leaf $L=L(x)$ on the set $\Omega_x.$


%{\bf Definition 11.} 
\begin{Def}
Since $K_{\frak
M}(L,x):=\{[h]\in\pi_1(l,x)\mid\Phi_x(\sigma,[h])
=\sigma,\,\forall\sigma\in\Omega_x\}=\ker\Phi_x$ is a normal
subgroup in $\pi_1(L,x),$ the quotient group $H_{\frak
M}(L,x):=\pi_1(L,x)/\ker\Phi_x$ is well defined~\cite{BH}. The group
$H_{\frak M}(L,x)$ is called the {\it $\frak M$-holonomy group of
the leaf $L$ of the foliation $(M,F)$ with the Ehresmann
connection} $\frak M.$
\end{Def}

It is known that there is a natural group epimorphism
$\delta\colon H_{\frak M}(L,x)\to\Gamma(L,x)$ onto the germ
holonomy group $\Gamma(L,x)$ of the leaf $L=L(x)$ such that
$$\beta=\delta\circ\alpha,\eqno{(*)}$$ where
$\alpha\colon\pi_1(L,x)\to H_{\frak M}(L,x)$ and
$\beta\colon\pi_1(L,x)\to\Gamma(L,x)$ are the natural projections
onto the corresponding quotient groups.

The following assertion is a consequence of Theorem~7 proved by
the author in~\cite{ZhNNGU04}.


%{\bf Proposition 6.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{Let $(M,F)$ be a foliation with
an Ehresmann connection $\frak M.$ The natural group epimorphism
$\delta\colon H_{\frak M}(L,x)\to\Gamma(L,x)$ satisfying the
relation $(*)$ is an isomorphism if and only if the holonomy
pseudogroup of the foliation $(M,F)$ is quasi-analytic. }
\end{Proposition}

{\bf Equivalent approaches to the notion of holonomy groups.}


%{\bf Theorem 4.} 
\begin{Theorem}
{Let $(M,F)$ be an $\frak
M$-complete foliation with TRG defined by an $(N,\xi)$-cocycle
$\{U_i,f_i,\{\gamma_{ij}\}\}.$ Let $L=L(x),$ $x\in M,$ be an
arbitrary leaf of this foliation and ${\cal L}={\cal L}(u),$
$u\in\pi^{-1}(x),$ be the corresponding leaf of the lifted

\item[] (ii) the group ${\cal H}_v$ formed by germs of local

transverse rigid geometry $(N,\xi)$ at point $v=f_i(x),$ where
$x\in U_i;$ 
\item[] (iii) the group of deck transformations of the
regular covering map $\pi|_{\cal L}\colon{\cal L}\to L;$
\item[] (iv) the subgroup $H({\cal L})=\{a\in H\mid R_a({\cal

group $\Phi(u)$ of the integrable connection $T({\cal
F}|_{\pi^{-1}(L)})$ in the principal $H$-bundle with the
projection $\pi|_{\pi^{-1}(L)}\colon\pi^{-1}(L)\to L.$
\end{itemize}
}
\end{Theorem}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
According to Proposition~2, an $\frak
M$-complete foliation $(M,F)$ with TRG has an Ehresmann connection
$\frak M.$ Recall that the holonomy pseudogroup ${\cal H}$ is a
subpseudogroup of the pseudogroup ${\cal H}(N,\xi)$ of all local
automorphisms of the transverse rigid geometry $(N,\xi).$
According to Proposition~1 ${\cal H}$ is a quasi-analytic
pseudogroup. Therefore applying Proposition~6 we see that
$\nu\colon H_{\frak M}(L,x)\to\Gamma(L,x)$ is a natural group
isomorphism.

Recall that according to Theorem~1 the restriction $\pi|_{\cal
L}\colon{\cal L}\to L$ is a regular covering with the deck
transformations group $H({\cal L}).$ Then there is a normal
subgroup $\rho_*(u)$ of the fundamental group $\pi_1(L,x)$ and a
group isomorphism $\mu_u\colon\pi_1(L,x)/\rho_*(u)\to H({\cal
L}).$

Denote by $\alpha\colon\pi_1(L,x)\to\Gamma(L,x)$ and
$\beta\colon\pi_1(L,x)\to\Phi(u)$ the natural group epimorphisms.
It is enough to show that $\ker\alpha=\ker\beta=\rho_*(u).$ Let
$[h]\in\ker\alpha,$ then $h$ is a loop at $x.$ Consider a chain
$U_1,\ldots,U_k,$ $U_i\cap U_{i+1}\neq\emptyset,$ $\forall
i\in\{1,\ldots,k-1\},$ of neighborhoods from the $(N,\xi)$-cocycle
$\eta$ that covers the set $h([0,1]).$ Let $f_i\colon U_i\to V_i$
be submersions and $\gamma_{js}$ be the corresponding local
automorphisms of the rigid geometry $(N,\xi)$ from $\eta.$
According to Proposition~4  for each $\gamma_{js}$ there is a
unique local automorphism $\Gamma_{js}$ of $\xi$ lying over
$\gamma_{js}.$

The composition of projections $\gamma:=
\gamma_{1k}\circ\gamma_{kk-1}\circ\ldots\circ\gamma_{21}$ is
defined in a neighborhood of the point $v := f_1(x)$ of the
manifold $N$. The triviality of the germ of $\gamma$ at $v$ is a
consequence of the choice of $[h]\in\ker\alpha.$ Therefore there
exists a neighborhood $V\ni v$ in $N$ such that $\gamma|_V =
\mathrm{id}_V.$ Due to the effectiveness of $\xi$, the
automorphism
$\Gamma:=\Gamma_{1k}\circ\Gamma_{kk-1}\circ\ldots\circ\Gamma_{21}$
satisfies the equality $\Gamma|_{P_V}=\mathrm{id}_{P_V}.$

Denote by $\tilde h$ the path in the leaf ${\cal L}$ with the
origin $u=\tilde h(0)$ covering the loop~$h.$ In the sequel, we
will use notations of the proof of Theorem~1. From the definition
of the lifted foliation $({\cal R},{\cal F})$ it is follows that
the chain $\tilde{U}_1,\ldots,\tilde{U}_k,$ where
$\tilde{U}_i=\pi^{-1}(U_i),$ covers the set $\tilde h([0,1]).$ As
$\tilde f_1(u)\in P_V,$ the equality
$\Gamma|_{P_V}=\mathrm{id}_{P_V}$ implies ${\Gamma(\tilde
f_1(u))=\tilde f_1(u)}$. Hence $\tilde f_1(\tilde h(1))=\tilde
f_1(\tilde h(0)).$ Therefore $\tilde h(1)=\tilde h(0)=u$ and
$h\in\ker\beta.$ Thus, $\ker\alpha\subset\ker\beta.$

The equality $\ker\beta=\rho_*(u)$ follows directly from the
definition of $\Phi(u)$~\cite{Minsets}. To complete the proof, we have to
show the implication $\rho_*(u)\subset\ker\alpha.$ Take any
${[h]\in\rho_*(u)}$. Let $\tilde h$ be the loop in ${\cal L}$
covering $h$ with the origin at $u=\tilde h(0).$ Then $\tilde
h(1)=\tilde h(0)=u.$ Consider an arbitrary  chain $U_1,\ldots,
U_r,$ $U_i\cap U_{i+1}\neq\emptyset,$ $\forall
i\in\{1,\ldots,r-1\},$ of neighborhoods belonging to the
$(N,\xi)$-cocycle $\eta$ that covers the set $h([0,1]).$ Let
$\gamma_{js}$ be the corresponding local automorphisms of
$(N,\xi)$ from $\eta.$ Let $\Gamma_{js}$ be the unique local
automorphism of $\xi$ with the projection $\gamma_{js}.$ It is
well known that any $e$-foliation has no holonomy. Then the
holonomy diffeomorphism
$\Gamma:=\Gamma_{1r}\circ\Gamma_{rr-1}\circ\ldots\circ\Gamma_{21}$
has the trivial germ at the point $\tilde f_1(u).$ Therefore its
projection
$\gamma:=\gamma_{1r}\circ\gamma_{rr-1}\circ\ldots\circ\gamma_{21}$
has the trivial germ at point $v=f_1(x).$ Since $\gamma$ is a
local holonomy diffeomorphism along the loop $h,$ we have
$[h]\in\ker\alpha.$

\section{Foliations with the zero structure Lie algebra}

%{\bf Proposition 7.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{Let $(M,F)$ be a complete
foliation with TRG. Suppose that $\frak g_0(M,F)=0.$ Let
$\pi_b\colon{\cal R}\to W$ be the basic fibration. Then:
\begin{itemize} 
\item[] (i) the formula $$\Phi^W\colon W\times H\to W\colon
  (w,a)\mapsto\pi_{\rm b} (R_a(u))\;\; \forall(w,a)\in W\times
  H,\;\;\forall u\in\pi_{\rm b} ^{-1}(w)$$ defines a smooth locally
  free action of the Lie group $H$ on the basic manifold $W;$
\item[] (ii) there is a homeomorphism $s\colon M/F\to W/H$ between the
  leaf space $M/F$ and the orbit space $W/H$ satisfying the equality
  $k\circ \pi_b=s\circ q\circ\pi,$ where $k\colon W\to W/H$ is the
  quotient map onto $W/H,$ $q\colon M\to M/F$ is the quotient map onto
  $M/F;$
\item[] (iii) the equality $\pi_b^*\bar\omega=\tilde\omega$ defines an
  $\mathbb{R}^m$-valued non-degenerate 1-form $\bar\omega$ on $W$ such
  that $\bar\omega(A^*_W)=A$, where $A^*_W$ is the fundamental vector
  field on $W$ defined by an element $A\in\frak h\subset\mathbb{R}^m.$
\end{itemize} }
\end{Proposition}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
(i) Since $\frak g_0(M,F)=0,$ by Theorem 2
the lifted foliation $({\cal R,F})$ is formed by the fibres of the
basic fibration  $\pi_b\colon{\cal R}\to W.$ The action $\Phi^W$
is well defined, because the lifted foliation $({\cal R,F})$ is
$H$-invariant. Smoothness of the action of $H$ on $\cal R$ and
smoothness of $\pi_b$ imply smoothness of $\Phi^W.$ Take any point
$w\in W$ and $u\in\pi_b^{-1}(w).$ Let ${\cal L}={\cal L}(u)$ and
$L:=\pi(\cal L),$ then $x=\pi(u)\in L.$ Recall that $H({\cal
L})=\{a\in H\mid R_a({\cal L})={\cal L}\}.$ Let $H_w$ be the
isotropy subgroup of $H$ at $w.$ From the definition of the action
$\Phi^W$ of the Lie group $H$ on $W$ it follows that $H({\cal
L})=H_w.$ The condition $\frak g_0(M,F)=0$ implies that the lifted
foliation $({\cal R,F})$ is proper, hence the induced foliation
$(\pi^{-1}(L),{\cal F}|_{\pi^{-1}(L)})$ is also proper. Therefore
the orbit $u\cdot H({\cal L})={\cal L}\cap \pi^{-1}(x)$ is a
discrete subset of the orbit $u\cdot H.$ So $H({\cal L})$ is a
discrete subgroup of the Lie group~$H.$

Thus, each isotropy group of the action $\Phi^W$ is discrete,
i.~e., $\Phi^W$ is a locally free action.

(ii) Consider an arbitrary point $x\in M,$ $u\in\pi^{-1}(x)$ and
$w=\pi_b(u).$ From (i) it is follows that
$\pi_b(\pi^{-1}(L(x))=w\cdot H.$ Hence the map $s\colon M/F\to
W/H\colon [L]\mapsto [w\cdot H],$ where $[L]$ is the leaf $L$
considered as a point of $M/F$ and $[w\cdot H]$ is the orbit of
$H$ considered as a point of $W/H,$ is well defined and satisfies
the equality $k\circ\pi_b=s\circ q\circ\pi$ stated in (ii). Since
$k$ and $q$ are open and continuous maps, this relation implies
that the bijection $s$ is a homeomorphism.

(iii) This statement is a consequence of the assertion~(ii) of
Theorem~1 and of the definition of the 1-form $\bar\omega.$ 
%\qed
\end{proof}

{\bf Corollary 1.} {\it If $\frak g_0(M,F)=0,$ then the
holonomy group $\Gamma(L,x)$ is isomorphic to the isotropy group
$H_w,$ where $w\in\pi_b(\pi^{-1}(x)),$ of the induced action
$\Phi^W$ of the Lie group $H$ on the basic manifold $W.$ }


%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
As shown in the proof of Proposition~7,
$H({\cal L})=H_w$. Therefore, according to Theorem~4, the holonomy
group $\Gamma(L,x)$ of a leaf $L$ of this foliation is isomorphic
to the isotropy group $H_w.$ 
%\qed

%\begin{center}{\large\bf 7. The groups of basic automorphisms of foliations with TRG}\end{center}

\section{The groups of basic automorphisms of foliations with TRG}

Let ${\cal A}(M,F)$ be the full automorphism group of a foliation
$(M,F)$ with TRG. We denote by $\mu\colon{\cal A}^H({\cal
R,F})\to{\cal A}(M,F)$ the group isomorphism defined in Theorem~3.


{\bf Leaf automorphisms.\,}  The group
$${\cal A}_L(M,F):=\{f\in{\cal A}(M,F)\mid
f(L_\alpha)=L_\alpha,\,\forall L_\alpha\in F\}$$ is a normal
subgroup of ${\cal A}(M,F)$ which is called the {\it leaf
automorphism group} of~$(M,F).$


%{\bf Proposition 8.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{Consider the subgroup of leaf
automorphisms ${\cal A}^H_L({\cal R,F}):=\{f\in{\cal A}^H({\cal
R,F})\mid \hat f({\cal L}_\alpha)={\cal L}_\alpha,\,\forall{\cal
L}_\alpha\in{\cal F}\}$ of the group ${\cal A}^H({\cal R,F}).$
Then the restriction $$\mu_L:=\mu|_{{\cal A}^H_L({\cal
R,F})}\colon{\cal A}^H_L({\cal R,F})\to {\cal A}_L(M,F)$$ is a
group isomorphism. }
\end{Proposition}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
Let $\hat f\in{\cal A}^H_L({\cal R,F})$ and
$f:=\mu(\hat f).$ Consider an arbitrary leaf $L\in F.$ There
exists a leaf ${\cal L}\in\cal F$ such that $\pi|_{\cal
L}\colon{\cal L}\to L$ is a covering map. As $\hat f({\cal
L})={\cal L}$ and $\pi\circ\hat f=f\circ\pi$ then $f(L)=L,$ hence
$f\in{\cal A}_L(M,F).$ Thus we have an inclusion $\mu({\cal
A}^H_L({\cal R,F}))\subset{\cal A}_L(M,F).$

Let us show that the map $\mu_L$ is surjective. Take an arbitrary
element $g\in{\cal A}_L(M,F).$ According to Theorem~3 there is a
unique element $\hat g\in{\cal A}^H({\cal R,F})$ lying over $g.$
Let $u$ be an arbitrary point in $\cal R,$ $u':=\hat g(u),$
$x=\pi(u),$ $L=L(x).$ There are neighborhoods $U_j\ni x$ and
$U_i\ni y=g(x)$ from the $(N,\xi)$-cocycle
$\eta=\{U_i,f_i,\{\gamma_{ij}\}\}$ defining the foliation $(M,F).$
Remark that the points $v:=f_j(x)$ and $v':=f_i(y)$ belong to the
same orbit of the holonomy pseudogroup ${\cal H}(M,F)$ of the
foliation $(M,F).$ Recall that each element of ${\cal H}(M,F)$ is
a local automorphism of the transverse rigid geometry $(N,\xi).$
Therefore there exists a local automorphism $\gamma_{ij}\in{\cal
H}(M,F)$ such that $\gamma_{ij}(v)=v'.$ Effectiveness of the
transverse rigid geometry $(N,\xi)$ implies the existence of a
unique local automorphism $\Gamma_{ij}$ of the rigid structure
$\xi$ from the holonomy pseudogroup ${\cal H}({\cal R,F})$ with
the projection $\gamma_{ij}.$ In the notations of the proof of
Theorem~1 $\tilde\eta=\{\tilde U_i,\tilde f_i,\{\Gamma_{ij}\}\}$
is a $(P,\omega)$-cocycle defining the $e$-foliation $({\cal
R,F}).$ Let $w=\tilde f_j(u),$ $w'=\tilde f_i(u')$ then
$w'=\Gamma_{ij}(w),$ i.~e., the points $w$ and $w'$ belong to the
same orbit of the holonomy pseudogroup ${\cal H}({\cal R,F}).$
Therefore the points $u$ and $u'$ belong to the same leaf ${\cal
L}$ of $(\cal R,F),$ i.~e., $\hat g({\cal L})=\cal L.$ Hence $\hat
g\in {\cal A}^H_L({\cal R,F}).$

Thus $\mu_L$ is an isomorphism of the groups ${\cal A}^H_L({\cal
R,F})$ and ${\cal A}_L(M,F).$ 
%\qed
\end{proof}

{\bf Basic automorphisms of foliations with TRG.\,}
Remark that the quotient group ${\cal A}^H_B({\cal R,F}):={\cal
A}^H({\cal R,F})/{\cal A}^H_L({\cal R,F})$ is well defined.


%{\bf Definition 12.} 
\begin{Def}
The quotient group $${\cal
A}_B(M,F):={\cal A}(M,F)/{\cal A}_L(M,F)$$ is called the {\it
basic automorphism group} of the foliation $(M,F)$ with TRG.
\end{Def}

Let $(M,F)$ be a foliation with TRG. Let $M/F$ be the leaf space
of $(M,F),$ and $q\colon M\to M/F$ be the natural projection onto
the leaf space which maps any $x\in M$ to the leaf $L(x)$
considered as a point $[L(x)]$ in $M/F.$ Each $f\in{\cal A}(M,F)$
maps an arbitrary leaf $L$ of $F$ onto some leaf of this
foliation. Hence the equality $\tilde f([L])=[f(L)]$ defines a
mapping $\tilde f$ of the leaf space $M/F$ onto itself such that
the following diagram
\begin{equation}\label{M/F}\begin{CD}
M          @>{q}>> M/F \\
@V{f}VV           @VV{\tilde f}V\\
M          @>{q}>> M/F.\\
\end{CD}
\end{equation}
is commutative. Since $q$ is an open and continuous mapping,
(\ref{M/F}) implies that $\tilde f$ is a homeomorphism of the leaf
space $M/F$. Denote by ${\cal A}(M/F)$ the set of all such
homeomorphisms of $M/F.$ Then $$\tilde q\colon{\cal
A}(M,F)\to{\cal A}(M/F)\colon f\mapsto\tilde f$$ is a group
epimorphism with the kernel $\ker\tilde q={\cal A}_L(M,F).$
Therefore the basic automorphism group  ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ is
canonically isomorphic to the group ${\cal A}(M/F).$ Thus the
basic automorphism group ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ can be considered as a
group, ${\cal A}(M/F)$, of homeomorphisms of the leaf space $M/F$
of this foliation.

Let us emphasize that the basic automorphism group ${\cal
A}_B(M,F)$ of a foliation $(M,F)$ with TRG is an invariant of this
foliation in the category ${\frak F}_{TRG}.$

%{\bf Proposition 9.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{Let $(M,F)$ be a
foliation with TRG and $({\cal R,F})$ be the lifted foliation.
Denote by ${\cal A}^H_B({\cal R,F})$ the quotient group ${\cal
A}^H({\cal R,F})/{\cal A}^H_L({\cal R,F}).$ There exists a natural
group isomorphism $\chi\colon{\cal A}^H_B({\cal R,F})\to{\cal
A}_B(M,F)$ satisfying the commutative diagram
\begin{equation}\label{HBRF}\begin{CD}
{\cal A}^H({\cal R,F})          @>{\mu}>> {\cal A}(M,F) \\
@V{r}VV           @VV{s}V\\
{\cal A}^H_B({\cal R,F})          @>{\chi}>> {\cal A}_B(M,F),\\
\end{CD}
\end{equation} where $r$ and $s$ are the associated group
epimorphisms onto the quotient groups. }
\end{Proposition}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
By Theorem~3, the map $\chi\colon{\cal
A}^H_B({\cal R,F})\to{\cal A}_B(M,F)\colon\hat h\cdot{\cal
A}^H_L({\cal R,F})\mapsto h\cdot{\cal A}_L(M,F),$ where $h$ is the
projection of $\hat h\in{\cal A}^H({\cal R,F})$ with respect to
$\pi\colon{\cal R}\to M,$ is well defined. According to
Proposition~8, $\mu(\ker r)=\ker s,$ where $\ker r$ and $\ker s$
are the kernels of the epimorphisms $r$ and $s,$ respectively.
Hence there exists an isomorphisms of the quotient groups ${\cal
A}^H_B({\cal R,F})$ and ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ satisfying the
diagram~(\ref{HBRF}).

\section{Conditions guarantee that ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ is a Lie group}

{\bf Uniqueness of a Lie group structure.\,} The next
proposition follows from Proposition~1 proved by Bagaev and the
author in~\cite{BZ}.


%{\bf Proposition 10.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{Let ${\cal A}(P,\omega)$ be
the Lie group of all automorphisms of a parallelizable manifold
$(P,\omega).$ If a group $G$ is realized as a closed subgroup of
${\cal A}(P,\omega),$ then $G$ admits a unique topology and a
unique smooth structure that make it into a Lie group. This
topology coincides with the compact-open topology. }
\end{Proposition}

{\bf The case $\frak g_0(M,F)=0$.\,} A leaf $L$ of a
foliation $(M,F)$ is called {\it closed} if $L$ is a closed subset
in the topology of the manifold $M.$ Further we use the term ``a
closed leaf'' only in this sense.

Let $(M,F)$ be a complete foliation with TRG and $\pi_b\colon M\to
W$ be the basic fibration. Suppose that $\frak g_0(M,F)=0,$ then
according to Theorem~2 the leaves of the lifted foliation $({\cal
R},{\cal F})$ coincide with the fibres of the basic fibration
$\pi_b\colon{\cal R}\to W.$ Hence the basic manifold $W$ can be
identified with the leaf space ${\cal R}/{\cal F}$ of the
foliation $({\cal R},{\cal F}),$ and $\pi_b$ can be identified
with the projection $\tilde q\colon{\cal R}\to{\cal R}/{\cal F}.$

Applying the commutative diagram~(\ref{M/F}) to the foliation
$({\cal R},{\cal F})$ we see that each automorphism $h\in{\cal
A}^H({\cal R},{\cal F})$ induces a diffeomorphism $\tilde h$ of
the manifold $W$ such that $\pi_b\circ h=\tilde h\circ\pi_b.$
Since $h^*\tilde\omega=\tilde\omega,$ then, from the definition of
the non-degenerate $\mathbb{R}^m$-valued 1-form $\bar\omega$ on
$W$ satisfying Proposition~7, it is follows that $\tilde
h^*\bar\omega=\bar\omega.$ From the definition of the action $H$
on $W$ it is follows that $h\circ R_a=R_a\circ h,$ $\forall a\in
H.$

As above, we denote by ${\cal A}(W,\bar\omega)$ the group of all
automorphisms of the parallelizable manifold $(W,\bar\omega),$
i.~e., ${\cal A}(W,\bar\omega):=\{f\in \mathrm{Diff} W\mid
f^*\bar\omega=\bar\omega\}.$ It is well known that ${\cal
A}(W,\bar\omega)$ admits a unique Lie group structure. There is a
natural bijection between the identity component ${\cal
A}_e(W,\bar\omega)$ of ${\cal A}(W,\bar\omega)$ and the orbit
${\cal A}_e(W,\bar\omega)\cdot v$ of a point $v\in W,$ being a
closed submanifold of $W.$ This bijection induces a smooth
structure on ${\cal A}_e(W,\bar\omega)$~\cite{KN1}. According to
Proposition~10, the topology of ${\cal A}(W,\bar\omega)$ is the
compact-open topology.

Let ${\cal A}^H(W):=\{f\in{\cal A}(W,\bar\omega)\mid f\circ
R_a=R_a\circ f\}$ and let ${\cal A}^H_e(W)$ be the identity
component of ${\cal A}^H(W).$ Then ${\cal A}^H(W)$ and ${\cal
A}^H_e(W)$ are closed Lie subgroups of ${\cal A}(W,\bar\omega).$


%{\bf Proposition 11.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{Let $(M,F)$ be a complete
foliation with TRG and $\frak g_0(M,F)=0.$ Then the map
$$\nu\colon{\cal A}^H_B({\cal R,F})\to{\cal A}^H(W)\colon
h\cdot{\cal A}^H_L({\cal R,F})\mapsto\tilde h$$ where $h\in{\cal
A}^H({\cal R,F})$ and $\tilde h$ is the projection of $h$ with
respect to $\pi_b\colon{\cal R}\to W$ is a group isomorphism onto
an open-closed Lie subgroup of the Lie group ${\cal A}^H(W).$ }
\end{Proposition}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
At first, consider the map
$\alpha\colon{\cal A}^H({\cal R,F})\to{\cal A}^H(W)\colon
h\mapsto\tilde h,$ where $\tilde h$ is the projection of $h$ with
respect to $\pi_b\colon M\to W.$ As shown above, $\tilde h\in{\cal
A}^H(W).$ It is clear that $\alpha$ is a group homomorphism with
the kernel $\ker\alpha$, being equal to the normal subgroup ${\cal
A}^H_L({\cal R,F}).$ Therefore, there exists a group isomorphism
$\nu\colon{\cal A}^H_B({\cal R,F})\to{\cal A}^H(W),$ satisfying
the equality $\alpha=\nu\circ r,$ where $r\colon{\cal A}^H({\cal
R,F})\to{\cal A}^H_B({\cal R,F})$ is the natural projection onto
the quotient group ${\cal A}^H_B({\cal R,F})={\cal A}^H({\cal
R,F})/{\cal A}^H_L({\cal R,F}).$

It is enough to prove that $\mathrm{im}\alpha$ is an open-closed
subgroup in ${\cal A}^H(W).$

If ${\cal A}^H(W)$ is a discrete Lie group, then
$\mathrm{im}\nu=\mathrm{im}\alpha$ is also a discrete Lie group.

Now suppose that $\dim{\cal A}^H(W)\geqslant  1.$ Let $\frak a$ be the
Lie algebra of the Lie group ${\cal A}^H(W)$ and $B$ be any
element of $\frak a.$ Denote by $B^*$ the fundamental vector field
defined by $B.$ Then $X:=B^*$ is a complete vector field and it
defines a 1-parameter group $\varphi^X_t,$ $t\in(-\infty,\infty),$
of diffeomorphisms of $W.$ The condition $\varphi^X_t\in{\cal
A}^H(W),$ $\forall t\in(-\infty,\infty)$ is equivalent to the
following relations: 1)~$L_XA^*_W=0,$ $\forall A\in\frak h;$
2)~$L_X\bar\omega=0.$

Since $\pi_b\colon{\cal R}\to W$ is a submersion with an Ehresmann
connection $\overline{\frak M},$ there exists a unique vector
field $Y\in\frak X_{\overline{\frak M}}({\cal R})$ such that
$\pi_{b*}Y=X.$ Remark that completeness of the vector field $X$
implies completeness of the vector field $Y.$ Hence $Y$ defines a
1-parameter group $\psi^Y_t,$ $t\in(-\infty,\infty),$ of
diffeomorphisms of the manifold $\cal R.$ Let us show that
$\psi^Y_t\in{\cal A}^H({\cal R,F}),$ $\forall
t\in(-\infty,\infty),$ i.~e., we have to check the validity of the
following facts: 1)~the map $\psi^Y_t,$ $t\in(-\infty,\infty),$ is
an isomorphism of $({\cal R,F})$ in the category $\frak Fol;$
2)~$L_Y\tilde\omega=0;$ 3)~$L_YA^*=0,$ $\forall A\in\frak h.$

1) The equality $\pi_{b*}Y=X$ implies the relation
$\pi_b\circ\psi^Y_t=\phi^X_t\circ\pi_b$ for any fixed
$t\in(-\infty,\infty),$ hence
$\psi^Y_t(\pi_b^{-1}(v))=\pi_b^{-1}(\phi^X_t(v)),$ $\forall v\in
W,$ and $\psi^Y_t$ is an isomorphism of the lifted foliation
$({\cal R,F})$ in the category $\frak F\frak o\frak l.$

2) Take arbitrary $u\in\cal R$ and $Z_0\in\overline{\frak M}_u.$
There is a unique vector field $Z\in\frak X_{\overline{\frak
M}}({\cal R})$ such that $Z|_{u}=Z_0$ and
$\tilde\omega(Z)=\tilde\omega(Z_0)=\mathrm{const}.$ Put
$Z_W:=\pi_{b*}Z$ and apply the following formula~\cite{KN1}:
\begin{equation}\label{formKN1}
(L_X\bar\omega)(Z_W)=X(\bar\omega(Z_W))-\bar\omega([X,Z_W]).
\end{equation}
The relation $\tilde\omega=\bar\omega\circ\pi_{b*}$ implies that
$\bar\omega(Z_W)=\tilde\omega(Z_0)=\mathrm{const},$ so
$X(\bar\omega(Z_W))=0.$ By the choice of $X$ we have
$L_X\bar\omega=0.$ Hence the equality~(\ref{formKN1}) gives
\begin{equation}\label{formKN2}
\bar\omega([X,Z_W])=0.
\end{equation}
In the formula
\begin{equation}\label{formKN3}
(L_Y\tilde\omega)(Z)=Y(\tilde\omega(Z))-\tilde\omega([Y,Z])
\end{equation}
the first term $Y(\tilde\omega(Z))=0,$ because
$\tilde\omega(Z)=\mathrm{const}.$ The relations
$\tilde\omega=\bar\omega\circ\pi_{b*}$ and~(\ref{formKN2}) imply
the following chain of equalities:
$$\tilde\omega([Y,Z])=\bar\omega(\pi_{b*}[Y,Z])=\bar\omega([\pi_{b*}Y,\pi_{b*}Z])=\bar\omega([X,Z_W])=0.$$
Therefore ~(\ref{formKN3}) implies that $(L_Y\tilde\omega)(Z)=0$
and $(L_Y\tilde\omega)(Z_0)=0.$ Thus, $L_Y\tilde\omega=0.$

3) Denote by $(W,F^H)$ the foliation formed by the connected
components of orbits of the action $\Phi^W$ of $H$ on $W.$ Let
$({\cal R},{\cal F}^H)$ be the foliation formed by the connected
components of orbits of the Lie group $H$ on $\cal R.$

At any point $u\in\cal R$ there is an neighborhood $\cal W$
foliated with respect to both foliations $({\cal R,F})$ and
$({\cal R},{\cal F}^H)$ which meets each leaf of these foliations
in at most one connected subset. We can suppose that the basic
fibration $\pi_b\colon{\cal R}\to W$ is trivial in the
neighborhood $\pi_b^{-1}({\cal V}),$ where ${\cal V}:=\pi_b({\cal
W}).$ Put $U=\pi({\cal W}).$ Let $r\colon U\to U/(F|_U)$ and
$s\colon{\cal V}\to{\cal V}/({\cal F}^H|_{\cal V})$ be the
quotient maps. We can identify $U/(F|_U)$ and ${\cal V}/({\cal
F}^H|_{\cal V})$ with the manifold $V$ such that the diagram
\begin{equation}\label{I}\begin{CD}
{\cal W}          @>{\pi_b}>> {\cal V} \\
@V{\pi}VV           @VV{s}V\\
U          @>{r}>> V,\\
\end{CD}
\end{equation}
where the restrictions of $\pi$ and $\pi_b$ onto ${\cal W}$ are
denoted by the same letters, is commutative. Without loss of
generality, we can assume that $\frak M|_U$ is an Ehresmann
connection for the submersion $r$ and $\overline{\frak M}|_{\cal
W}$ is an Ehresmann connection for the submersion $\pi_b.$

By the choice of $X,$ for any $A\in\frak h$ we have the equality
$L_XA^*_W=0$, i.~e., ${[A^*_W,X]=0}$. Since the fundamental vector
fields span the tangent spaces to the leaves of the foliation
$(W,F^H),$ it is not difficult to check that $X$ is a foliated
vector field for this foliation. Hence the vector field
$X_V:=s_*X|_{\cal V}$ is well defined. There is a unique vector
field $Y_U\in\frak X_{\frak M}(U)$ such that $r_*Y_U=X_V.$ In
other words, $Y_U$ is the $\frak M$-horizontal lift of $X_V.$ The
commutative diagram~(\ref{I}) implies the relation
$\pi_{b*}Y_{\cal W}=Y_U,$ hence $Y$ is a foliated vector field
with respect to the foliation $({\cal R},{\cal F}^H).$ Therefore,
\begin{equation}\label{1}[A^*,Y]\in\frak X_{{\cal F}^H}({\cal
R}).\end{equation} According to Theorem~1, we have the equalities
$\tilde\omega(A^*)=\bar\omega(A^*_W)=A,$ hence $A^*$ is a vector
field foliated with respect to $({\cal R,F}).$ So we have the
following chain of equalities
$$\pi_{b*}[A^*,Y]=[\pi_{b*}A^*,\pi_{b*}Y]=[A^*_W,X]=0,$$ hence,
\begin{equation}\label{2}[A^*,Y]\in\frak X_{\cal F}({\cal
R}).\end{equation} The relations~(\ref{1}) and~(\ref{2}) imply the
equality $[A^*,Y]=0,$ $\forall A\in\frak h.$

Thus, we proved the inclusion ${\cal
A}^H_e(W)\subset\mathrm{im}\alpha=\mathrm{im}\nu.$ Therefore
$\mathrm{im}\nu$ is an open-closed Lie subgroup of the Lie group
${\cal A}^H(W).$

%{\bf Theorem 5.} 
\begin{Theorem}
{ Let $(M,F)$ be a complete
foliation with a transverse rigid geometry $(N,\xi),$ where
$\xi=(P(N,H),\omega).$ Suppose that the structure Lie algebra
$\frak g_0(M,F)$ is zero. Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] (i) the full basic automorphism group ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ is
  realized as an open-closed subgroup of the Lie group ${\cal A}^H(W)$
  and admits a Lie group structure with the following estimate of its
  dimension:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{oz1}
    \dim{\cal A}_B(M,F)\leqslant \dim P;
  \end{equation}
\item[] (ii) if either there exists an isolated closed leaf $L$ or the
  set of closed leaves of the foliation $(M,F)$ is countable, then
  \begin{equation}
    \label{oz2}
    \dim{\cal A}_B(M,F)\leqslant \dim H;
  \end{equation}
\item[] (iii) there exists a unique topology and a unique smooth
  structure on the full group ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ of basic automorphisms
  of the foliation $(M,F)$, making ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ into a Lie
  group. This topology coincides with the compact-open topology, when
  ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ is realized as a subgroup of the group ${\cal
    A}^H(W)$.
\end{itemize} }
\end{Theorem}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
(i) Applying Propositions~9 and~11, we get
that the map $\beta:=\nu\circ\chi^{-1}\colon {\cal
A}_B(M,F)\to{\cal A}^H(W)$ is a group isomorphism of the full
group of basic automorphisms ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ onto an open-closed
subgroup $\mathrm{im}\beta$ of the Lie group ${\cal A}^H(W)$. We
identity ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ with $\mathrm{im}\beta$ and consider
${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ as an open-closed subgroup of the Lie group
${\cal A}^H(W)$. Hence ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ admits a Lie group
structure, and the following estimates of dimensions hold:
$$\dim{\cal A}_B(M,F)\leqslant \dim{\cal A}^H(W)\leqslant \dim{\cal
A}(W,\bar\omega)\leqslant \dim W=\dim P=m.$$

(ii) Suppose that there exists a closed leaf $L$ of the foliation
$(M,F).$ Then $\pi_b(\pi^{-1}(L))$ is a closed orbit of the action
$\Phi^W$ of the Lie group $H$ on $W.$ Let us to fix an arbitrary
point $v$ in this orbit. Let $L^W=L^W(v)$ be a leaf of the
foliation $(W,F^W).$ Then the leaf $L^W$ is a closed subset in
$W.$ It is known~\cite{Kob} that the smooth structure of the Lie group
${\cal A}^H_e(W)$ coincides with the smooth structure induced by
the bijection of the identity component ${\cal A}^H_e(W)$ of the
Lie group ${\cal A}^H(W)$ onto the closed submanifold ${\cal
A}^H_e(W)\cdot v$ of $W,$ where ${\cal A}^H_e(W)\cdot v$ is the
orbit of the point $v.$ Any $g\in{\cal A}^H_e(W)$ maps each closed
orbit of the Lie group $H$ onto some closed orbit of $H.$ Since
${\cal A}^H_e(W)\cdot v$ is connected and either the orbit $v\cdot
H$ is isolated or if the set of closed orbits of $H$  is
countable, so ${\cal A}^H_e(W)\cdot v\subset L^W.$ Therefore
$\dim{\cal A}_B(M,F)\leqslant \dim{\cal A}^H_e(W)\cdot v\leqslant \dim F^H=\dim
H.$

(iii) Applying the statement (i) proved above and Proposition~10
to the group ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ we get the statement (iii).
 %\qed
\end{proof}

%{\bf Remark 6.} 
\begin{Remark}
Theorem 5 does not exclude the triviality
of the full group ${\cal A}_B(M,F).$
\end{Remark}

%{\bf Remark 7.} 
\begin{Remark}
The main result of the work~\cite{Bel} by Belko
is the theorem asserting that if there exists a closed leaf of a
foliation $(M,F)$ with complete transversally projectable affine
connection, then the group ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ is a Lie group. This
statement is not correct. It's proof essentially uses the fact
that existence of a closed leaf of this foliation implies that the
lifted foliation is simple. It is not true, in general. Let us
consider a foliation $(M,F)$ from Example~3  (in Section~10), when
$r=1/\pi$, as affine foliation. It has a compact leaf, but $\frak
g_0(M,F)=\mathbb{R}^1\neq 0,$ hence the lifted foliation is not
simple. Thus the foliation $(M,F)$ is a Lie foliation with
non-zero structure Lie algebra $\frak g_0(M,F),$ and the group
${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ is not a Lie group.
\end{Remark}

{\bf Discrete holonomy groups of leaves.\,}
Let $(M,F)$ be a complete foliation with TRG. Let $\pi\colon{\cal
R}\to M$ be the projection of the foliated bundle over $(M,F)$.


%{\bf Definition 13.} 
\begin{Def}
We say that the holonomy group of a
leaf $L\ni x$ of the foliation $(M,F)$ is {\it discrete} if there
exists a point $u\in\pi^{-1}(x)$ such that the group $H({\cal
L}):=\{a\in H\mid R_a({\cal L})={\cal L},\,{\cal L}={\cal
L}(u)\in{\cal F}\}$ is a discrete subgroup of the Lie group $H.$
\end{Def}

Let $u'\in\pi^{-1}(x)$ and $u'\neq\in {\cal L}={\cal L}(u).$ In
this case the subgroup $H({\cal L'})$ is conjugate to the subgroup
$H({\cal L})$ in the Lie group $H.$ Hence $H({\cal L})$ is a
discrete subgroup of $H$ iff $H({\cal L'})$ is a discrete subgroup
of $H.$ Thus, by Theorem~4 the notion of discrete holonomy group
of leaf $L$ is well defined.

Recall that a leaf $L$ of a foliation $(M,F)$ is said to be {\it
proper} if $L$ is an embedded submanifold  in $M.$ A foliation
$(M,F)$ is called {\it proper} if each its leaf is proper.


%{\bf Proposition 12.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{Let $(M,F)$ be a complete
foliation with TRG. If there exists proper leaf $L$ with discrete
holonomy group then the structure Lie algebra $\frak g_0(M,F)$ is
zero. }
\end{Proposition}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
Let $L$ be a proper leaf with discrete
holonomy group. Let $x\in L,$ $u\in\pi^{-1}(x),$ and ${\cal
L}={\cal L}(u).$ Since $L$ is proper, there exists a foliated
neighborhood $U$ of the point $x$ such that $L$ meets $U$ in a
connected subset $L\cap U.$ Then there is a neighborhood $\cal U$
of $u$ foliated with respect to $({\cal R},{\cal F})$ such that an
embedded submanifold $\pi^{-1}(L)$ of $\cal R$ meets $\cal U$ in a
connected subset. Since the subgroup $H({\cal L})$ of $H$ is
discrete, ${\cal L}\cap\pi^{-1}(x)=u\cdot H({\cal L})$ is a
discrete subset of the fiber $\pi^{-1}(x).$ Therefore, there
exists a neighborhood ${\cal V}\subset\cal U$ of $u$ foliated with
respect to the foliation $(\cal R,F)$ such that $\cal L\cap{\cal
V}$ is connected. By~\cite[Theorem~4.11]{Tam}, it follows that the leaf
$\cal L$ is proper. Thus the complete $e$-foliation $(\cal R,F)$
has a proper leaf $\cal L.$ It is known~\cite{Con} that such a foliation
is formed by the fibers of a locally trivial fibration. Hence all
leaves of the lifted foliation $(\cal R,F)$ are closed and the
structure Lie algebra $\frak g_0(M,F)$ is zero. 
%\qed
\end{proof}

%{\bf Theorem 6.} 
\begin{Theorem}
{  Let $(M,F)$ be a complete
foliation with transverse rigid geometry $(N,\xi),$ where
$\xi=(P(N,H),\omega).$ If at least one of the following conditions
holds:
\begin{itemize} 
\item[] (i) there exists a proper leaf $L$ with discrete holonomy group;
 \item[] (ii) there is a closed leaf $L$ with discrete holonomy group;
 \item[] (iii) there exists a proper leaf $L$ with finite holonomy group;
 \item[] (iv) there is a closed leaf $L$ with finite holonomy group,
\end{itemize}
then the basic automorphism group ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ admits a Lie
group structure of dimension at most $\dim P,$ and this structure
is unique. }
\end{Theorem}


%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
Remark that any closed leaf of a
foliation is proper and each finite holonomy group is a discrete
one. Hence we have implications $(iv)\Rightarrow (iii) \Rightarrow
(ii) \Rightarrow (i).$ According to Proposition~12 the existence
of a proper leaf $L$ with discrete holonomy group guarantees the
equality $\frak g_0(M,F)=0.$ Thus, applying Theorem~5 we get the
required assertion. 
%\qed
\end{proof}

It is well known that any foliation has leaves without holonomy.
Therefore, the following statement is a consequence of the
assertion (iii) of Theorem~6.


{\bf Corollary 2.} {\it  For any proper complete
foliation $(M,F)$ with TRG the basic automorphism group ${\cal
A}_B(M,F)$ admits a unique Lie group structure. }

\section{Foliations covered by fibrations}

{\bf $(G,X)$-foliations.\,} It is said that a group of
diffeomorphisms of a manifold $X$ {\it acts quasi-analytically,}
if existence of an element $g\in G$ and an open subset $U$ in $X$
such that $g|_U=\mathrm{id}_U$ implies $g=\mathrm{id}_X.$

Let $G$ be a Lie group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold $X$, which
acts quasi-analytically on $X.$ Recall that $(M,F)$ is a
$(G,X)$-foliation if $(M,F)$ is defined by an $\eta$-cocycle
$\{U_i,f_i,\{\gamma_{ij}\}\},$ where $f_i\colon U_i\to V_i$ is a
submersion onto an open subset of $X$, for each $\gamma_{ij}$
there is $g\in G$  such that $\gamma_{ij}=g|_{f_j(U_i\cap U_j)}$
and $\{V_i\}$ is a covering of $X.$ Uniqueness of such a $g\in G$
is a consequence of quasi-analyticity of the action of $G.$


%{\bf Definition 14.} 
\begin{Def}
Let $(X,\xi)$ be a rigid geometry,
where $\xi=(P(H,X),\omega),$ let $G$ be an automorphism group of
$(X,\xi).$ A $(G,X)$-foliation $(M,F)$ is called a {\it
$(G,X)$-foliation with transverse rigid structure.}
\end{Def}

{\bf Foliations covered by fibrations.\,} Let
$f\colon\tilde M\to M$ be the universal covering map.


%{\bf Definition 15.} 
\begin{Def}
We say that a foliation $(M,F)$ {\it
is covered by a fibration} if the induced foliation $\tilde
F:=f^*F$ on $\tilde M$ is formed by the leaves of a submersion
$r\colon\tilde M\to B$ onto a $q$-dimensional manifold $B,$ where
$q$ is codimension of the foliation $(M,F).$
\end{Def}

%{\bf Proposition 13.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{ Let $(M,F)$ be a foliation
with TRG, which admits an Ehresmann connection $\frak M$ and is
covered by a fibration $r\colon\tilde M\to B,$ where
$f\colon\tilde M\to M$ is the universal covering map. Then:
\begin{itemize} 
\item[] (i) $B$ is simply connected, the submersion
$r\colon\tilde M\to B$ is a locally trivial fibration; 
\item[] (ii) the manifold $B$ admits a rigid geometry $\zeta$ locally
  isomorphic to $(N,\xi);$ 
\item[] (iii) there is a group epimorphism
  $\alpha\colon\pi_1(M)\to\Psi$ onto some subgroup $\Psi$ of
  automorphisms of the rigid geometry $(B,\zeta)$: the group $\Psi$ is
  called the global holonomy group of the foliation covered by a
  fibration; the foliation $(M,F)$ is a $(\Psi,B)$-foliation with
  TRG; 
\item[] (iv) for any $x\in M$, the holonomy group $\Gamma(L,x)$
  of the leaf $L=L(x)$ is isomorphic to the isotropy subgroup
  $\Psi_y,$ where $y\in r(f^{-1}(x)).$
\end{itemize}
}
\end{Proposition}

% {\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
(i) By Proposition~2, the
distribution $\frak M$ is an Ehresmann connection for foliation
$(M,F).$ It is not difficult to check that the distribution
$\tilde{\frak M}=f^*\frak M$  is an Ehresmann connection for the
foliation $(\tilde M,\tilde F),$ hence $\tilde{\frak M}$ is an
Ehresmann connection for the submersion $r\colon\tilde M\to B.$ It
is well known that a submersion admitting an Ehresmann connection
is a locally trivial fibration. Thus, the foliation  $(\tilde
M,\tilde F)$ is formed by the fibres of the locally trivial
fibration $r\colon\tilde M\to B.$ Hence $r\colon\tilde M\to B$ is
a fibration with the covering homotopy property. Applying the
exact homotopy sequence and the fact that the leaves of $r$ are
arcwise connected and the manifold $\tilde M$ is simply connected,
we see that the basic manifold $B$ is also simply connected.

(ii) Let $f_i\colon U_i\to V_i$ be a submersion from the
$(N,\xi)$-cocycle $\eta$, defining $(M,F).$ Without loss of
generality, we can assume that $U_i$ is a regularly covered
neighborhood, i.~e., $f^{-1}(U_i)=\sqcup {\cal W}_\alpha$ is a
disjunct sum of neighborhoods ${\cal W}_\alpha$ such that
$f|_{{\cal W}_\alpha}\colon{\cal W}_\alpha\to U_i$ is a
diffeomorphism. Therefore there exists a diffeomorphism
$\gamma_\alpha\colon {\cal V}_\alpha=r({\cal W}_\alpha)\to V_i$
satisfying the equality $\gamma_\alpha\circ r=f_i\circ f$ on
${\cal W}_\alpha.$ The diffeomorphism $\gamma_\alpha$ induces a
rigid geometry $\zeta_\alpha=(\tilde P_\alpha({\cal
V}_\alpha,H),\omega_\alpha),$ where $\tilde
P_\alpha:=\gamma_\alpha^*P_\alpha$ on ${\cal V}_\alpha$, such that
$\gamma_\alpha\colon{\cal V}_\alpha\to V_i$ is an isomorphism of
$({\cal V}_\alpha,\zeta_\alpha)$ and $(V_i,\xi_{V_i}).$ By a
straightforward verification, one can show that there exists a
unique rigid structure $\zeta=(\tilde P(H,B),\beta)$ on $B$ such
that $\zeta|_{{\cal V}_\alpha}=\zeta_\alpha.$

(iii) Let us consider the fundamental group $\pi_1(M,x),$ $x\in
M,$ as the group $G$ of deck transformations of the universal
covering map $f\colon\tilde M\to M.$ Since each $g\in G$ is an
isomorphism of the induced foliation $(\tilde M,\tilde F)$ and the
basic manifold $B$ of the fibration $r\colon\tilde M\to B$ can be
considered as the leaf space $\tilde M/\tilde F,$ $g$ defines a
map $\psi\colon B\to B$ satisfying the relation $r\circ
g=\psi\circ r.$ Hence $\psi$ is a diffeomorphism of $B.$ Moreover,
from the definition of the rigid geometry  $\zeta$ on $B$ it
follows that $\psi\in{\cal A}(B,\zeta).$ Denote by $\Psi$ the
group of all such $\psi.$ Then there is a group epimorphism
$\chi\colon\pi_1(M,x)\to \Psi\colon g\mapsto \psi,$ where $r\circ
g=\psi\circ r.$

(iv) As $f\colon\tilde M\to M$ is the covering map, we can consider
$(M,F)$ as a $(\Psi,B)$-foliation. Then the holonomy pseudogroup
${\cal H}$ of $(M,F)$ is determined by the group~$\Psi.$ Since $\Psi$
acts quasi-analytically on $B$, for each $y\in B$ the group ${\cal
  H}_y$, which consists of germs at $y$ of transformations from the
isotropy subpseudogroup of the holonomy pseudogroup $\cal H$, is
isomorphic to the isotropy subgroup $\Psi_y.$ According to Theorem~4,
the holonomy group $\Gamma(L,x)$ is isomorphic to ${\cal H}_y,$ where
$y\in r(f^{-1}(x)),$ and hence the group $\Gamma(L,x)$ is isomorphic
to $\Psi_y.$
 %\qed
\end{proof}

According to Proposition~2 a complete foliation $(M,F)$ with TRG
admits an Ehresmann connection, hence the following assertion is
true.


{\bf Corollary 3.} {\it If $(M,F)$ is a complete
foliation with TRG, then the statements of Proposition~13 are
valid for $(M,F).$ }


{\bf Basic automorphism groups of foliations with TRG covered by fibrations.\,}
In the following theorem we give and apply another interpretation
of the structure Lie algebra of a foliation $(M,F)$ with TRG
covered by a fibration.


%{\bf Theorem 7.} 
\begin{Theorem}
{Let $(M,F)$ be a complete foliation
with TRG covered by a fibration $r\colon\tilde M\to B,$ where
$f\colon\tilde M\to M$ is the universal covering map. Let $\Psi$
be the global holonomy group of $(M,F)$ considered as a subgroup
of the Lie group ${\cal A}(B,\zeta)$ of all automorphisms of the
rigid geometry $(B,\zeta)$, which was introduced in
Proposition~13. Then:
\begin{itemize} 
\item[] (i) the structure Lie algebra $\frak
g_0(M,F)$ is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the Lie group
$\overline{\Psi},$ where $\overline{\Psi}$ is the closure of
$\Psi$ in the full Lie group of automorphisms ${\cal A}(B,\zeta)$
which is a Lie group; 
\item[] (ii) the equality $\frak g_0(M,F)=0$
is equivalent to the condition that $\Psi$ is a discrete subgroup
of the Lie group ${\cal A}(B,\zeta);$ 
\item[] (iii) if $\Psi$ is a
discrete subgroup of the Lie group ${\cal A}(B,\zeta),$ then the
full group of basic automorphisms ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ admits a Lie
group structure, and this structure is unique.
\end{itemize}
}
\end{Theorem}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
As above, let $\pi\colon{\cal R}\to M$ be
the projection of the foliated bundle over $(M,F)$ and
$f\colon\tilde M\to M$ be the universal covering map. Put
$\tilde{\cal R}:=f^*{\cal R}=\{(y,u)\in\tilde M\times{\cal R}\mid
f(y)=\pi(u)\},$ $\tilde\pi\colon\tilde{\cal R}\to\tilde
M\colon(y,u)\mapsto y,$ $\varphi\colon\tilde{\cal R}\to{\cal
R}\colon(y,u)\mapsto u.$ A right action of $H$ on $\tilde{\cal R}$
is defined by the equality $(y,u)\cdot a = (y,u\cdot a),$ $\forall
a\in H.$ It is easy to see that a principal $H$-bundle
$\tilde\pi\colon\tilde{\cal R}\to\tilde M$  equipped with a
foliation $(\tilde{\cal R},\tilde{\cal F}),$ where $\tilde{\cal
F}=\varphi^*\tilde{\cal F},$ is the foliated bundle for the
foliation $(\tilde M,\tilde F).$ Since $(\tilde M,\tilde F)$ is a
simple foliation defined by submersion $r\colon\tilde M\to B,$ so
$(\tilde{\cal R},\tilde{\cal F})$ is also simple foliation defined
by the projection of the basic fibration
$\tilde\pi_b\colon\tilde{\cal R}\to\tilde W.$ In general, when the
Lie group $H$ is not connected, the manifold $\tilde{\cal R}$ is
not simply connected. Remark that the lifted $e$-foliation $(\cal
R,F)$ is covered by fibration $\tilde\pi_b\colon\tilde{\cal
R}\to\tilde W.$ The fundamental group $G=\pi _1(M,x)$ acts on
$\tilde{\cal R}$ by the formula $g(y,u):=(g(y),u), \forall(y,u)\in
\tilde{\cal R}, \forall g\in G.$ Hence $g\circ R_a = R_a\circ g,
\forall a\in H, \forall g\in G.$ Moreover, each $g$ is an
automorphism of the foliation $(\tilde{\cal R},\tilde{\cal F})$ in
the category $\frak F\frak o\frak l.$ Therefore $G$ induces a
group $\tilde\Psi\subset Diff (\tilde W).$ Let $s\colon\tilde W\to
B$ be a map defined by the equality
$s\circ\tilde\pi_b=\widetilde{\pi}\circ r.$ Analogously to proof
of Proposition~13, a rigid structure $\zeta=(\tilde
W(H,B),\theta)$ with the projection $s\colon\tilde W\to B$ is
defined, and $(B,\zeta)$ is a rigid geometry, $\tilde\Psi\subset
\cal {A}(\zeta).$ Furthermore the group isomorphism $\cal
{A}(\zeta)\to \cal {A}(B,\zeta)$ maps $\tilde\Psi$ onto $\Psi.$

Consider any leaf ${\cal L}={\cal L}(u),$ $u\in\cal R,$ of $(\cal
R,F).$ Let $z\in\varphi^{-1}(u)$ and $d=\tilde\pi_b(z).$ Since
$\tilde\Psi\subset \cal {A}(\zeta)\subset \cal {A}(\tilde
W,\theta),$ so $\overline{\tilde\Psi\cdot d}=(cl\tilde\Psi)\cdot
d,$ where $\overline{\tilde\Psi\cdot d}$ is the closure of the
orbit $\tilde\Psi\cdot d$ in $\tilde W,$  and $cl\tilde\Psi$ is a
closure of $\tilde\Psi$ in the Lie group ${\cal A}(\zeta).$ Hence
the closure $\overline{\cal L}$ of $\cal L$ in $\cal R$ satisfies
the equality $\overline{\cal
L}=\varphi(\tilde\pi_b^{-1}((cl\tilde\Psi)\cdot d)).$
 Denote by $(cl\tilde\Psi)_e$ the identity
component of the Lie group $cl\tilde\Psi,$ then
$(cl\tilde\Psi)_e\cdot d$ and
$\mathbb{L}:=\tilde\pi_b^{-1}((cl\tilde\Psi)_e\cdot d)$ are
connected smooth manifolds, with
$\varphi|_\mathbb{L}\colon\mathbb{L}\to\overline{\cal L}$ is a
regular covering map. The induced foliation
$(\varphi|_{\mathbb{L}})^*({\cal F}|_{\overline{\cal L}})$ is
simple and is defined by a submersion
$\tilde\pi_b|_\mathbb{L}\colon\mathbb{L}\to (cl\tilde\Psi)_e\cdot
d\cong (cl\tilde\Psi)_e.$ It is known~\cite{Mol_book} that this implies that
the structure Lie algebra of the Lie foliation $(\overline{\cal
L},{\cal F}|_{\overline{\cal L}})$ with dense leaves is isomorphic
to the Lie algebra of the Lie group $(cl\tilde\Psi)_e.$ Since
$\Psi$ is the projection of $\tilde\Psi$ with respect to
$s\colon\tilde W\to B,$ so effectiveness of $\zeta$ implies that
the Lie groups $\overline{\Psi}$ and $cl\tilde\Psi$ are
isomorphic.

The statement (ii) is a direct consequence of the statement~(i).
Therefore the assertion~(iii) follows from Theorem~5.

{\bf Basic automorphisms of foliations with integrable Ehresmann
connections.}


% {\bf Proposition 14.} 
\begin{Proposition}
{Let $(M,F)$ be an $\frak

$\frak M$ is integrable and, therefore, defines a foliation

structure.
\end{itemize}
}
\end{Proposition}

%{\bf Proof.} 
\begin{proof}
By assumption, $M$ is endowed with two
transverse foliations $(F,F^t)$ of dimensions $p$ and $q,$
respectively, where $p+q=\dim M.$ According to Proposition~2, the
distribution $\frak M=TF^t$ is an Ehresmann connection for the

Let $f\colon\tilde M\to M$ be the universal covering map. Let
$\tilde F:=f^*F,$ $\tilde F^t:=f^*F^t$ be the induced foliations
on $\tilde M$ and $\tilde{\frak M}:=T\tilde F^t.$ Remark that
$\tilde{\frak M}=f^*\frak M$ is an integrable Ehresmann connection
for the foliation $(\tilde M,\tilde F).$ In the terminology of
Section~3, the simply connected manifold $\tilde M$ is endowed
with two transverse foliations $(\tilde F,\tilde F^t)$ such that
for any pair of curves $(\sigma,h)$  with a common initial point
$\sigma(0)=h(0),$ where $\sigma$ is a horizontal curve and $h$ is
a vertical curve, there exists a vertical-horizontal homotopy~$H$
with the base $(\sigma,h).$ In other words, the conditions of the
famous Kashiwabara's theorem about the decomposition of
manifolds~\cite{Kash} (rediscovered by Blumenthal and Hebda~\cite{BH}) are
satisfied. According to this theorem there exists a diffeomorphism
$\Phi$ of $\tilde M$ onto a product of manifolds $L\times B$ which
is an isomorphism in the category $\frak F\frak o\frak l$ of two
pairs of foliations: first, of $(\tilde M,\tilde F)$ and $(L\times
B,F_1),$ where $F_1=\{L\times\{z\}\mid z\in B\},$ second, of
$(\tilde M,\tilde F^t)$ and $(L\times B,F_2),$ where
$F_2=\{\{y\}\times B\mid y\in L\}.$ We identify $\tilde M$ with
$L\times B$ by means of $\Phi,$ while the foliation $(\tilde
M,\tilde F)$ is identified with the trivial foliation $(L\times
B,F_1).$ Therefore the foliation $(M,F)$ is covered by the trivial
fibration $r\colon L\times B\to B.$ Thus, $(M,F)$ satisfies
Theorem~7.

\section{Examples}

{\bf Foliations obtained by suspension of a
homomorphism.\,} Let $\rho\colon\pi_1(B,b_0)\to{\rm Diff}(T)$ be a
homomorphism of the fundamental group of a manifold $B\ni b_0$
into the group of diffeomorphisms of a $q$-dimensional manifold
$T,$ and let $p\colon\hat B\to B$ be the universal covering
mapping. Then we have a right action of the group
$\Pi:=\pi_1(B,b_0)$ on $\hat B$ by deck transformations. The
equality $$(x,t)\cdot g:=(x\cdot g,\rho(g^{-1})(t)),\quad \forall
(x,t)\in\hat B\times T,\quad\forall g\in\Pi,$$ defines a free
right properly discontinuous smooth action of the group $\Pi$ on
the product of manifolds $\hat B\times T$; therefore the quotient
manifold $M:=\hat B\times_\Pi T$ is defined. Let $\kappa\colon\hat
B\times T\to M$ be the natural projection. Then $F:=\{\kappa(\hat
B\times\{t\})\mid t\in T\}$ is a foliation of codimension $q$ on
$M;$ in this case, it is said that the {\it foliation $(M,F)$ is
obtained by suspension of the homomorphism} $\rho.$ For this
foliation we will use the notation $(M,F) := \mathrm{Sus}(T,B,
\rho)$ suggested in~\cite{CZ}. The image $\Psi:=\mathrm{im}\rho$ is the
global holonomy group of $(M,F).$

{\bf Transversally similar and transversally homothetic foliations.\,}
Let $G$ be the similarity group of the Euclidean space
$\mathbb{E}^q,$ $q\geqslant  1,$ and $\mathbb{R}^+$ be the multiplicative
group of positive real numbers. Then $G =
CO(q)\rightthreetimes\mathbb{R}^q$ is the semidirect product of
the conformal group $CO(q) = \mathbb{R}^+\cdot O(q)$ and the group
$\mathbb{R}^q.$ Let $H = CO(q)$ and $p\colon G\to
G/H=\mathbb{E}^q$ be the canonical principal $H$-bundle. Let
$\frak g$ be the Lie algebra of the Lie group $G,$ and $\omega$ be
the Maurer-Cartan $\frak g$-valued 1-form on $G.$ Then
$\xi=(G(\mathbb{E}^q,H),\omega)$ is an effective rigid geometry.
Foliations with this transverse geometry $(\mathbb{E}^q,\xi)$ are
called {\it transversally similarity foliations}~\cite{Minsets}.

Denote by $E$ the neutral element of the group $O(q).$ If
$G=(\mathbb{R}^+\cdot E)\rightthreetimes\mathbb{R}^q,$
$H=\mathbb{R}^+\cdot E,$ and $\omega$ is the Maurer-Cartan $\frak
g$-valued 1-form on the Lie group $G,$ then foliations with the
transverse effective rigid geometry $(\mathbb{E}^q,\xi),$ where
$\xi=(G(\mathbb{E}^q,\mathbb{R}^+\cdot E),\omega),$ are called
{\it transversally homothetic foliations}~\cite{Minsets}.

%{\bf Example 1.} 
\begin{Example}
Let $B$ be a smooth
$p$-dimensional manifold whose fundamental group $\pi_1(B,b)$
contains an element $\alpha$ of infinite order. For an arbitrary
natural number $q\geqslant  1,$ denote
 by $\mathbb{E}^q$ a $q$-dimensional Euclidean space. Define a
homomorphism $\rho\colon\Pi:=\pi_1(B,b)\to{\rm
Diff}(\mathbb{E}^q)$ by setting $\rho(\alpha)=\psi,$ where $\psi$
is the homothetic transformation of the Euclidean space
$\mathbb{E}^q$ with the coefficient $\lambda\neq 1,$ i.~e.
$\psi(x)=\lambda x,$ $\forall x\in\mathbb{E}^q,$ and
$\rho(\beta)=\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb{E}^q}$ for any element
$\beta\in\pi_1(B,b)$ such that $\beta\neq \alpha^k$ with some
integer $k.$ Then $(M,F)=\mathrm{Sus}({\Bbb E}^q,B,\rho)$ is a
proper transversally similar foliation with a unique closed leaf
diffeomorphic to $B.$

According to Corollary~2, the full basic automorphism group ${\cal
A}_B(M,F)$ of this foliation $(M,F)$ admits a Lie group structure.
Let us compute the group ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ and show that this fact
is indeed true.

The group $\Pi_0:=\ker\rho$ acts on $\hat B\times\mathbb{E}^q$
properly discontinuously, hence the quotient manifold $\hat
B\times_{\Pi_0}\mathbb{E}^q=B_0\times\mathbb{E}^q,$ where
$B_0:=\hat B/\Pi_0,$ is defined. The quotient group
$\Psi_0:=\Pi/\Pi_0\cong\mathbb{Z}$ acts from the right on the
product of manifolds $B_0\times\mathbb{E}^q$ such that
$M=B_0\times_{\Psi_0}\mathbb{E}^q$ and the quotient map
$\kappa\colon M_0:=B_0\times\mathbb{E}^q\to M$ is a regular
covering map with the deck transformation group $\Psi_0.$ The
foliation $(M_0,F_0),$ where $F_0:=\kappa^*F,$ is formed by the
fibres of the projection $\mathrm{pr}_2\colon
M_0=B_0\times\mathbb{E}^q\to\mathbb{E}^q$ onto the second factor.

The group ${\cal A}(\xi)$ is equal to the group of left
translations of the Lie group
$G=CO(q)\rightthreetimes\mathbb{R}^q,$ hence we can identify
${\cal A}(\mathbb{E}^q,\xi)\cong{\cal A}(\xi)$ with $G.$ For any
$h\in G$ the transformation $h'=(\mathrm{id}_{B_0},h)$ of
$B_0\times\mathbb{E}^q$ belongs to ${\cal A}(M_0,F_0)$. Therefore,
the map $\alpha\colon{\cal A}(M_0,F_0)\to G\colon h'\mapsto h,$
where $h\circ\mathrm{pr}_2=\mathrm{pr}_2\circ h',$ is a group
epimorphism with $\ker\alpha={\cal A}_L(M_0,F_0).$ Let us
emphasize that $\hat f\in{\cal A}(M_0,F_0)$ lies over an
automorphism $f\in{\cal A}(M,F)$ if and only if it satisfies the
relation $\hat f\circ\Psi_0=\Psi_0\circ\hat f.$ Remark that
$\alpha(\Psi_0)=\Psi\subset{\cal A}(\mathbb{E}^q,\xi)=G$ is the
global holonomy group of the foliation $(M,F).$ Let $N(\Psi)$ be
the normalizer of $\Psi$ in the Lie group $G.$ It is not difficult
to check that the map $$\beta\colon{\cal A}_B(M,F)\to
N(\Psi)/\Psi\colon f\cdot{\cal A}_L(M,F)\mapsto \alpha(\hat
f)\cdot\Psi,$$ where $\hat f\in{\cal A}(M_0,F_0)$ lies over $f$
with respect to the map $\kappa,$ is a group isomorphism, hence
${\cal A}_B(M,F)\cong N(\Psi)/\Psi.$

In our case $\Psi=\langle\psi\rangle$ and
$N(\Psi)=\mathbb{R}^+\cdot O(q),$ therefore ${\cal A}_B(M,F)\cong
U(1)\times O(q),$ where $U(1)\cong(\mathbb{R}^+\cdot E)/\Psi$ is
the compact 1-dimensional abelian group.

If $q=1,$ then $O(q)=\mathbb{Z}_2$ and ${\cal A}_B(M,F)\cong
U(1)\times \mathbb{Z}_2.$
\end{Example}

%{\bf Example 2.} 
\begin{Example}
Consider the foliation $(M,F)$ constructed in Example 1 as a
transversally homothetic foliation, i.~e., with a different
transverse rigid geometry. In this case the Lie group ${\cal
A}_B(M,F)$ is isomorphic to the quotient Lie group $N(\Psi)/\Psi,$
where $N(\Psi)$ is the normalizer of $\Psi$ in the Lie group
$(\mathbb{R}^+\cdot E)\rightthreetimes\mathbb{R}^q.$ Since
$N(\Psi)=\mathbb{R}^+\cdot E,$ so ${\cal A}_B(M,F)\cong U(1).$
\end{Example}

%{\bf Remark 9.} 
\begin{Remark}
In both examples 1 and 2 the foliation
$(M,F)$ has a closed leaf and, in Theorem~3, the equality is
achieved in the estimate~(ii) of the dimension of ${\cal
A}_B(M,F)$.
\end{Remark}

%{\bf Example 3.} 
\begin{Example}
Let $\psi$ be the rotation of the plane
$\mathbb{E}^2$ about the point $0\in\mathbb{E}^2$ through the
angle $\delta=2\pi r.$ Consider an Euclidean metric $g$ on
$\mathbb{E}^2.$ Denote by $Iso(\mathbb{E}^2,g)$ the full isometry
group of $(\mathbb{E}^2,g).$ Let
$\rho\colon\pi_1(S^1,b)\cong\mathbb{Z}\to Iso(\mathbb{E}^2,g)$ be
defined by the equality $\rho(1):=\psi,$ $1\in\mathbb{Z}.$ Then we
have a suspended Riemannian foliation
$(M,F):=\mathrm{Sus}(\mathbb{E}^2,S^1,\rho).$ This foliation has a
unique closed (compact) leaf.

There exists a group isomorphism between ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ and the
quotient group $N(\Psi)/\Psi,$ where $\Psi=\langle\psi\rangle$ and
$N(\Psi)$ is the normalizer of $\Psi$ in the Lie group
$Iso(\mathbb{E}^2,g)$ identified with
$O(2)\rightthreetimes\mathbb{R}^2.$ Since $N(\Psi)=O(2),$ so
${\cal A}_B(M,F)=O(2)/\Psi.$ Hence ${\cal A}_B(M,F)$ admits a Lie
group structure if and only if $\Psi$ is a closed subgroup of
$O(2)$ or, equivalent, when $\delta=2\pi r$ for some rational
number $r.$

If $\delta=2\pi r,$ where $r$ is a non-zero rational number, then
${\cal A}_B(M,F)\cong O(2).$
