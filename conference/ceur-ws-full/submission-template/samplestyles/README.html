<H1>Some style files for CEUR-WS.org</H1>

<b>
WARNING: THE STYLE FILES ARE ONLY EXAMPLES. WORKSHOP ORGANIZERS PLANNING
TO USE THEM SHOULD ADAPT THEM TO THEIR NEEDS AND ALSO CHECK WHETHER
THEY WORK AS EXPECTED. WE CANNOT PROVIDE LATEX DEBUGGING. THE 
STYLE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY MAY WELL CONTAIN BUGS!<br><br>

The LaTeX style files for preparing the paper are
<ul>
<li> onecolceurws.sty: for preparing plain proceedings papers; no page numbers
<li> onecolpceurws.sty: for preparing plain proceedings papers; with page numbers
<li> twocolceurws.sty: for preparing two-column style papers; no page numbers
<li> twocolpceurws.sty: for preparing two-column style papers; with page numbers
</ul>
<p>
Use the file paper1.tex as an example for a plain paper (uses onecolceurws.sty). 
If you want to produce a two-column paper then use paper2.tex
(uses twocolceurws.sty) as a starter. 
Both styles omit page numbers (see pagestyle in the style file).
The variants paper1p.tex and paper2p.tex are
just including page numbers.
If you have omitted pagenumbers, then you 
easily produce a PDF with all papers and consecutive page numbers
with the LaTeX <A HREF="http://ceur-ws.org/latex-pagenumbers.tex">script</A>
by Daniel A. Sadilek. See <A HREF="http://CEUR-WS.org/Vol-324/dsml08.pdf">Vol-324/dsml08.pdf</A>
to see the compiled proceedings file. You can use a suitable PDF cutter tool
to recover the individual papers with the absolute paper numbers from the overall proceedings
file.

<p>
As editor of a workshop proceedings volume, you can pick the most suitable style file,
and then adapt the clause <tt>\copyrightspace</tt> to reflect the right workshop title,
date and editors. You are also welcome to adapt other settings like the page layout to
your needs. We strongly recommend to use this clause because it lets readers trace back
a PDF paper to the workshop where it was published.

<p>
If you use other text processing software than LaTeX, then print out the suitable
paper*.pdf  and adapt your text
 processing software to the layout.

Generate the PDF for A4 paper format with
<PRE>
   % latex paper1.tex
   % dvipdf paper1.dvi
</PRE>
The other variants are created analogously.
<p>

<p> The style files were derived from the VLDB style;
permission to use for CEUR-WS.org was kindly granted by the Board of Trustees
of VLDB (www.vldb.org). You are welcome to share alternative style files
with us!
