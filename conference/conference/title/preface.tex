These are the proceedings of the selected papers of the VII International
Conference ``Information and
Telecommunication Technologies and Mathematical Modeling of High-Tech
Systems''. 
%(within the framework of the 53rd Russian Conference on
%Mathematics, Informatics, Physics and Chemistry).  
The conference took
place in Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University),
Moscow, Russia on April 16--20, 2018.

The conference continued the tradition of the Russian Conference on
Problems of Mathematics, Informatics, Physics and Chemistry, annually
held in the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN
University), starting almost from the moment of its foundation.

Information and telecommunication technologies, as a component of
information and telecommunication systems, belong to the priority
areas of science, technology and technology development, 
and the development of high-tech systems and the
improvement of information and telecommunication technologies is
impossible without the mathematical modeling.

The purpose of the conference was to combine the efforts of Russian and
foreign universities, academic research institutes, research centers,
enterprises and commercial companies to develop the accumulated
experience, identify the most relevant areas of scientific research in
the field of information and telecommunication technologies,
mathematical modeling, artificial intelligence, economic modeling and
other important directions in the development of scientific research.

Participation in the conference of leading scientists not only  from Russia
made this conference a unique event, within
the framework of which there was a discussion of topical problems and
innovative tasks.

All scientific proceedings presented at the conference were prior
reviewed by the expert council and a further public discussion of the
results took place on the Breakout Sessions.  The presented 
selection of reviewed scientific
papers gave an assessment of content, execution style, scientific,
practical and applied value of the works.
